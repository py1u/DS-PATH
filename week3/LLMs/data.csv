0,"on the arrival we were busy on the tcas as there were multiple targets in our general vicinity when were given 6,000 msl. we were then given a descent to 5,000. upon landing i was told to call the tracon and was told i violated an altitude. after examination of the situation, we either answered a descend to 5,000 ft clearance intended for another airplane or replied to the clearance to descend to 6,000 ft and put 5,000 ft in the altitude window in error.     in either situation there was a conflict with other traffic and i understand it is not acceptable. i will request a copy of the tape for my own personal use and possible training to other people in the future. to prevent this from happening in the future i will make sure to look at the altitude window and point to verify the altitude assigned and not just repeat without visual confirmation. i am personally and professionally embarrassed by this mistake.,...while we were descending to 6,000 ft we were cleared to 5,000 ft and when we were at 5,000 ft we got an ra on the tcas and right after that we were assigned to turn left to a heading of 270 to avoid traffic.","a be-40 flight crew experienced a tcas ra when they descended to 5,000 when cleared to 6,000."
1,"we performed the pre-flight inspection of the aircraft and found no discrepancies. i was functioning as the cfi for the pilot flying who was a certificated private pilot, instrument rated, and with a prior endorsement for complex and high-performance aircraft (asel) operation.    after our engine run-up, we were cleared for take-off. the aircraft accelerated normally however shortly after we began our takeoff roll, the nose gear retracted and the propeller struck the runway. the fuel and electrical were immediately shut off and the tower was notified. we immediately noted that the gear handle was in the up position.     at no time did either pilot move the gear handle. the aircraft checklist was used for all phases of flight; however, the up-position of the gear handle was apparently missed. i believe that somehow the gear was placed in the up position prior to our flight and this was simply overlooked by both of us.    contributing factors included not following the initial checklist to the letter which called for confirming that the gear handle was in the down-position and the incorrect expectation that an aircraft which had been flown earlier in the day would not be expected to have the gear-handle in the up-position.,[no substantive additional information was provided in the secondary narrative.]",when the instructor and student pilots' aboard a c172rg failed to note the gear switch was in the up position prior to starting their takeoff roll they experienced the collapse of the nose gear and a sudden engine stoppage when the prop struck the runway.
2,"lft has an fdc notam which indicates as follows: lft 01/006 lft rwy 4r/22l ne 1433 clsd wef 1201xxxxx. my flight was instructed to taxi to and hold short of runway 22l via taxiway foxtrot, lima, hold short of runway 22l at lima. i complied with the taxi instruction. due to our five hour weather delay caused by the approaching weather system which concerned me as causing the possibility of windshear, i desired to use as much runway as practical for my departure. once prepared for takeoff, i advised my first officer to request a back-taxi from the control tower on [runway] 22l. we were given a clearance to back-taxi on runway 22l, cleared for takeoff, climb and maintain 2,000 ft, and maintain runway heading. when i began my back-taxi, i noted that there were no runway markings identifying the closed portion of the runway. there were barricades which closed portions of taxiway juliet, but i was using taxiway lima anyway. there was a displaced threshold which was marked by the yellow chevrons which we are all accustomed to. there was a white line at the end of the displaced threshold (also typical of any other displaced runway threshold of which i am familiar with). i taxied across the white line while looking for some identifiable marking to indicate to me at which point i should make my turn around. as i continued across the white line, it began to become apparent to me that i could not see anything identifying where the runway closure began or ended. since i was on a displaced threshold and since the control tower had cleared me for the back taxi, i believed that i was utilizing the open portion of the runway. at some point after crossing the white line, i realized that i was not going to be able to identify the beginning of the closed portion of the runway, at which point i made my 180 degree turnaround and began my reduced thrust takeoff run without incident. at no point in time did atc ever instruct me to stop or turn around. if i did in fact encroach on any closed portion of the runway, it was purely due to the lack of proper runway markings to identify where the closure began. since it is obviously ridiculous to assume that i can accurately gauge 1,433 ft from the cockpit without a distance measuring device, then i think it's fair to say that it is impossible under the circumstances that i have just described to positively identify the proper end of the runway acceptable for use for takeoff. if you compound these factors, with my weather, schedule delays, and windshear concerns, then it is easy to understand how something like this situation can be overlooked. i truly do hope that the airport manager at the lafayette regional airport in lafayette, louisiana would make a better effort at insuring that the runway environment is properly identified. furthermore, it would be nice to see them actually open the runway up completely once again. i am very familiar with the field and yet it seems like every time i fly in, there is some new part of the airport notam'ed out of service.","a corporate pilot reported that he was unable to determine where the closed 1,433 ft of lft runway 22l began while back-taxiing from taxiway l toward the runway's end."
3,"flight crew briefed and understood the ruudy4 departure from teb prior to takeoff, including engagement of the autopilot before the first level-off (wentz). departure was properly loaded in fms. after takeoff, at approximately 500 ft msl, the fms automatically switched from hdg mode to lnav mode, as the crew had briefed and expected.    in capturing the lnav mode, somewhere between 1.3 and 2.3 miles on the departure, the flight director commanded an initial turn to [toward] the 260 heading [track] before correcting back to the 240 heading. during this time, the pilot flying followed the command bars, turning to the 260 heading before the charted intercept from the 240 heading. atc queried if the aircraft was on the departure and said it looked like we had turned too early. at this point the pilot flying returned to a 240 heading to rejoin the departure.    while i responded to the radio call i also noted that the pilot flying had climbed to an altitude of 1,600 ft msl and made the statement \altitude.\ the pilot flying corrected to 1,500 msl. the altitude situation could have been avoided by engagement of the autopilot at 1,000 ft, as briefed prior to takeoff. the aircraft avionics did try to make an abrupt capture and would have caused the airplane to turn off course even if the autopilot had been engaged.     better situational awareness on the part of flight crew would have lead the pilot flying to follow the departure procedure as depicted on the chart rather than relying solely on the command bars.","a momentary erroneous right turn command as the fms transitioned from heading to lnav mode while flying the ruudy rnav sid from teb resulted in a premature turn to intercept the track to wentz. that distraction contributed to a small altitude deviation when the pilot flying failed to level at 1,500 ft msl as charted."
4,"after traveling internationally and requiring customs clearance upon return to the us, i felt the need to fly a gps approach, with lowest available minima and continued below those published minima in an attempt to complete the approach. the major factor in my decision was the perceived need to clear customs as pre arranged at this airport and my perception of the consequences for not doing so. my decision to \take a look\ and go below published minimums could have been a fatal. fortunately we successfully completed a missed approach and diverted to another airport where we were cleared in with no complications.     adding to the unsafe condition--which i caused--an additional consequence was that while i continued to fly the plane, it then fell to my co-pilot to concentrate on figuring out how to contact customs in order to obtain approval; essentially causing me to fly single pilot in a congested terminal area in imc conditions. atc played a vital role in obtaining approval from customs for us to clear at our diversion airport. they should be commended for their assistance. by so doing they allowed my copilot to return his attention to flying the plane.    conversely, however, the controller also informed me that customs would not agree to allow us to land at a much closer international airport and required us to continue to the much smaller airport at a further distance. in this case no accident or incident occurred and everything worked out fine, however i think something should be done to give pilots the option of diverting to an acceptable airport without concern for repercussions from the customs and immigrations officials. while i do not condone going below published minima i understand my decision to do so in order to not create complications with customs and border protection.",a gulfstream flight crew felt compelled to descend below minima at their destination due to their belief they must clear customs as pre-arranged. after going around they diverted to another airport where they cleared without delay.
5,"we inadvertently installed # 2 slat that turned out to be 'not-effective' for our aircraft because it had not been modified for the winglet modification (mod) by adding a vortilon to the leading edge. our illustrated parts catalog (ipc) showed that part number (p/n) xxx-51g was 'effective', but we missed the part about being modified for winglet aircraft. the aircraft was ferry flight back to the u.s. for final repairs in which the slats were removed again and reinstalled. the correct p/n for the modified slat is 767-xxx-51g1.     the aircraft has had the winglets installed for awhile. the winglet modified aircraft have several differences that not everyone is aware of, or even know to look for them. the aircraft never made a revenue flight before the problem was found march 2012, when the captain noticed the vortilon missing and denied the b767-300 aircraft. it was brought back to the hangar where i installed the vortilon early next morning per an engineering authorization (e/a) and a job card for modifying the slat to the [correct] configuration. i re-marked the slat with the new p/n 767-xxx-51g1, which is 'effective' for the aircraft. i then returned the aircraft back to full service. the ipc should be revised to show that only p/n (767-xxx-51g1) is effective for that aircraft, at the #2 slat position.","a line mechanic reports he was involved with inadvertently installing a leading edge slat on a b767-300 aircraft that was not 'effective' for the #2 slat position. the slat had not been modified for winglet modified (mod) aircraft, which required adding a vortilon to the leading edge."
6,"a md88 was on final approach to runway xxr, about a 12 nm final. we were notified that an md80 was returning to the airport with smoke in the cockpit, he had just departed the airport about 2 minutes prior. i pulled his tag up and he was about 5 nm west of the airport on a modified downwind to runway xxr. the final controller called and told me to put the md88 on runway xxl that the md80 was going to runway xxr. i cleared the md88 for a visual approach to runway xxl and also cleared him to land. there was a military exercise going on in the uncontrolled area between runway yy and runway xxl. this exercise required several cfr vehicles to be attendant to the exercise for fire safety during the operations. when i got word about the emergency aircraft, i called the fire truck and told him about the emergency. the fire truck was also at the military ramp and requested to transition to the west side of the airport where the emergency md80 would be landing. i told the fire truck to cross runway yy and runway xxl. about ten seconds later i noticed the md88 flaring out over the numbers on runway xxl. the fire truck had just crossed runway yy and was about 500 ft from the intersection of taxiway c and runway xxl when the md88 crossed the same intersection. i reiterated for the fire truck to cross runway xxl and contact ground control (gc) on the other side. although the timing was such that the fire truck could not have made it to the intersection to be a factor for the md88, it still startled me and i realized that there was a potential for a serious runway incursion. added to this scenario were two runway yy arrivals, frequency confusion with cfr command, and the emergency md80. this plus the fact that two cfr vehicles were in a different place than usual contributed to the work load. i should have kept my arrival pad up to date and noted the fact that the md88 was now going to runway xxl and not runway xxr. this would have been a visual clue that runway occupancy would have prevented me from crossing the fire truck. i also used incorrect phraseology/procedures in issuing two crossing clearances in one transmission to the fire truck. adherence to proper phraseology would have given me a second opportunity to ensure runway separation.,[narrative #2 had no additonal information.]","tower controller described an unsafe event involving runway crossings, several emergency vehicles participating in a military exercise, and other emergency vehicle responding to an inbound emergency air carrier aircraft."
7,"a b737 was at 110. his data block had a trailing r, which is supposed to indicate the aircraft is on an rnav sid, in this case the ceeme1 arrival. this aircraft was supposed to be on the fernando5 arrival, due to an equipment issue with their fleet. when i inquired as to which arrival the b737 was on, the pilot replied the fernando5 and that they were issued \a screwed up routing to get there\. i reported the anomaly to my flm, who contacted zla. the response was \the b737 cannot get rid of the trailing r and zla will not remove it either. the sct controllers will need to verify that the b737 aircraft have the appropriate arrival. a bad situation gets worse with the ceeme1 arrival. we now have aircraft tagged with one arrival, but on another arrival, but we also need to verify which arrival they actually are on. turn off the ceeme1 arrival completely until it cannot be fixed. it is a safety hazard in its current form. tag aircraft that are on a non-rnav sid appropriately.,[narrative #2 had no additional information.],[narrative #3 had no additional information.]",sct controller described a route discrepancy and incorrect data block information associated with one company that is causing this anomaly.
8,"cleveland was on a north flow. an ac50 was 15 miles southwest of the tower talking to radar. radar pointed the ac50 out to the tower requesting to descend into bkl on a visual approach. i accepted the point out. when ctl was about 4 miles southwest of cleveland, i had the ac50 in sight and i cleared a b737 for take off on runway headed. the b737 had a release time that i was trying to meet. it was my intention that the b737 would be airborne well in front of the ac50. the b737 did not begin takeoff roll as quickly as i anticipated. when the b737 rotated i realized that the aircraft was not ahead of the ac50. i turned the b737 northbound to 035 heading but the ac50 also turned northbound in the visual approach. i stopped the b737's altitude at 3,000 ft and turned the aircraft farther north to a 360 heading. once the two aircraft were no longer in conflict, i shipped the b737 to departure. i had both aircraft in sight at all times and i was talking to the b737 until the necessary radar separation was achieved. the incident was a poor judgment call that resulted in unsafe proximity. in the future, i will not attempt to beat an airborne aircraft with one that is still on the ground and i will take into account that the pilot will start takeoff roll at their discretion.",cle controller described a potential conflict event when he/she departed an air carrier trying to get ahead of airborne traffic landing at an adjacent airport.
9,"a glex was at 11,000 ft on the ceeme1 arrival. i asked the glex if he had the notam to depart fim vor on the 136 radial to toaks. he replied \yes\. i instructed the glex to descend via the ceeme1 arrival. he read the clearance back. i issued the glex a frequency change to the woodland sector. the glex reported with woodland radar level at 11,000 ft, when he should have been descending to 7,000 ft. this is yet another situation where the ceeme1 arrival is obviously confusing to each pilot, leaving the controllers with no idea what to expect from each aircraft. turn off the ceeme1 arrival until it can be fixed and every flight crew and controller can be properly trained.    a sr22, departed vny airport on the newhall6 departure; which calls for a turn to heading 110 and a climb to 4,000 ft. this procedurally separates vny departures from bur arrivals. the sr22, for some unknown reason, turned northbound at the glex. the valley sector controller and the woodland sector controller recognized the abnormal departure simultaneously. the valley radar controller issued an immediate right turn to the sr22 away from the glex. the sr22 and the glex were at the same altitude seconds from a nmac if not a collision. this is not the first time a vny ifr departure has misapplied the newhall 6 departure and took a left turn into the bur localizer. the newhall 6 departure needs to be looked into, and each pilot who thinks they should turn beyond h110 should be asked what they read into the sid that made them think they should turn northbound. we need to find out where the deficiency in this sid lies.",sct controller voiced concern regarding the continued confusion experienced by pilots with regard to the altitude restrictions on the ceeme1 star as well as potential conflicts with vny newhall sid traffic.
10,"a c150 called me on tower frequency, inbound to land from the southeast. a few minutes later, the pilot reported green laser light activity from the area west of the airport. the c150 was at 2,000 ft entering a left downwind for runway 19 at the time. aircraft landed without further incident. i don't know if there is much that can be done to prevent unauthorized laser events, but it was helpful finding the phraseology for the 5 minute announcements and the atis broadcast in the 7110.65. maybe if laser light events was indexed, it would be faster to find.","tower controller described a green laser event, noting references to same could be better indexed in the 7110.65."
11,"my wife and i were departing redlands municipal arpt on a vfr flt to catalina. prior to tkof i contacted norton gnd on 121.8 and stated my intentions. i was clred through norton's ata and told to contact norton twr. i called the twr on 119.45 and was told to rpt when airborne. we departed and began flying a hdg of 240 degs, clbing to 4500' msl. i contacted norton twr about 30 secs after tkof. i was given a squawk issued by ontario apch through norton twr and was told to rpt passing through 2700' msl. about 2 mins later norton twr informed me that a heavy mlt was going to depart rwy 6 for closed right tfc. i responded that i had mlt y in sight on the rwy. mlt y began its tkof and as soon as it had enough alt it began a clbing right turn. i had not expected him to turn so soon and it became apparent to me at this time that y and i were in immediate conflict. i called norton twr and told him that i was at y's 1 o'clock pos. i did not wait for a reply and immediately began a steep dive from about 2500' to around 2300. about 15 secs later mlt y passed directly over my acft. at no time that i was on norton's freq did i hear the twr advise the mil plt of my pos or direction of flt. the mlt was using uhf freqs and i was on vhf. the twr was using uhf/vhf simultaneously. i feel this incident occurred because the twr did not advise mlt y of my pos and also because 2 different freq bands were being used. had y been on vhf, they would have heard my xmissions. i feel that in the interest of safety, all acft operating in close prox under atc ctl be on the same radio band and freq. many times while talking to norton or ont apch i have heard mil acft using vhf freqs. it makes it much easier to understand their intentions when you can hear both sides of the conversation.",nmac between sma and mlt. operational error by mil twr fac.
12,"during the takeoff, above v1, the first officer's flight instruments became erratic and unreliable. the captain's flight instruments were erratic, but reliable (confirmed with the emergency back up instruments). numerous faults were alerted. an emergency was declared and a safe landing was made at the departure airport.",md11 captain experiences erratic flight instruments after v1 during takeoff. an emergency is declared and the flight returns to the departure airport.
13,"on takeoff, maximum thrust at near maximum takeoff weight, we experienced loud bangs, shaking and vibrations right at gear retraction. captain was the pilot not flying on this leg. there were no associated eicas warning/caution alerts (audible or visible) at this time. there had been a previous issue with the nose strut from a recent prior logbook entry, thus we all thought that the nose gear had some problem. with the noise and vibrations that were happening at the time, i elected to cycle the gear back down to see if extending the nose gear would help the situation. by this time in the climb out, we went into the clouds and we then saw red flashes from the left side of the aircraft and associated bangs. it was also at this time, i saw a red flashing engine #1 n1 indication on the upper eicas display. it read approximately 114.5 to best of my knowledge. we all saw the indication immediately and the relief pilot asked me to check the secondary engine instruments. we determined the engine was in distress and i got the b747-400 quick reference checklist and we secured the #1 engine using the severe damage checklist. the relief pilot took over talking to atc. the first officer had continued the climb out complying with the star and then was given a vector off of the departure after we declared the emergency and had stabilized the situation. in this situation, the cleanup of the aircraft took place after the engine was secured, which is nonstandard to our training. this happened without any of us questioning why we were securing the engine prior to cleanup. we talked about this decision later and agreed that the bangs and shaking were violent enough that the engine needed to be secured right away before any other damage to the aircraft could occur from engine #1's condition at that time. with the engine secured, we asked for vectors to a fuel dumping area and asked for a climb to a higher altitude. once we were given permission, we started dumping fuel. we dumped approximately 220,000 lbs of fuel to get to below maximum landing weight. we set up for an ils and i took over as the flying pilot at that time and briefed for an ils autoland. we coordinated for cfr to meet the aircraft after landing to inspect the aircraft and engine for damage. the landing was uneventful. we taxied off the runway and once cfr inspected the aircraft and we were cleared, we taxied back to the ramp and shutdown normally. we elected to leave the flaps extended so maintenance could inspect for any damage. of note; this aircraft had an engineering order placed on the #1 engine the previous day, from a borescope inspection that showed damage to the 1st and 2nd stages of the engine blades. because of this previous logbook write up, we had actually been concerned with the engine and i elected to do a 20 second 70% runup prior to brake release on takeoff to check engine vibration levels. they appeared normal at that time, so we proceeded with the takeoff.,just after raising the gear on a maximum gross weight, max mode takeoff, we began hearing loud reports that sounded like they were coming from the left nose area. we had issues with the nose strut leaking earlier and suspected the nose gear. the gear was lowered again. we then noticed the #1 engine n1 spiking and pulled up the engine instruments. the engine noise and vibrations got worse and worse rapidly. we were concerned about significant damage happening to the aircraft without prompt action. the decision was made to secure the engine prior to completing the clean up. after securing the engine, the crew completed the cleanup; we declared an emergency and asked for vectors and a climb to dump fuel. we contacted dispatch after formulating a plan and prepping for return. center was notified of our intentions and tower was called. we landed uneventfully after dumping was complete.,the day before the event the crew was scheduled to fly the same aircraft and the aircraft had several maintenance issues. first, the #1 engine had blade damage that was inspected by maintenance and general electric. the engine was deemed flyable but needing to be replaced within the next 10 flights. second, the nose strut was nearly bottomed out and had leaked a significant amount of fluid. the nose strut was serviced and passed the leak check but still looked low. the flight the previous day did not take place due to crew day based on a long chain of events. the next day the crew pre-flighted the same aircraft and briefed several precautions prior to takeoff; the nose strut could cause an issue on the takeoff roll and the #1 engine should be run-up to about 70% prior to takeoff to check for any engine vibrations. upon takeoff the landing gear was raised and simultaneously a loud bang and significant aircraft vibration took place. we received no warning indications. the crew immediately felt there was an issue with the nose gear either coming loose or a nose gear door flapping on the side of the airplane. we decided to lower the gear. at about 1,000 ft agl the relief pilot suggested to bring up the engine instruments on the lower eicas display and both the captain and relief pilot noticed the #1 n1 indicator had entered the red zone followed by a chugging feeling sensed by me, flying the aircraft. the #1 engine thrust lever was reduced and we felt the engine might be coming apart, possibly causing further damage to either the wing or the #2 engine. a decision was made to shut down the #1 engine and complete the shutdown checklist. after the crew felt confident that the #1 engine was under control we noticed that gear and flaps were still down. we cleaned up the aircraft, declared an emergency and were vectored away from the airport up to 15,000 ft to dump fuel. after fuel dumping the crew flew an uneventful 3 engine approach to an auto-land conducted by the captain.","b747-400 flight crew describe the events surrounding an engine failure and in flight shutdown shortly after takeoff. the noise and vibration coming from the number one engine sufficiently unnerved the three pilot flight crew so the engine was shutdown before the aircraft was cleaned up. the engine was scheduled for replacement due to blade damage, but was deemed serviceable by maintenance and the manufacturer."
14,"climbing out, we got an e-1 fire bell, eicas, and red handle. we verified that all three were present and proceeded to run memory items. when we retarded the thrust lever the messages and bell and light all went out. i determined that we should continue as if it were a fire so i declared an emergency and asked to go back to [departure airport]. we ran [the procedure] and returned on one engine. before returning i asked the first officer if he felt comfortable flying single engine and he did, so i managed atc, pa, flight attendant, and checklists. the first officer lost some altitude but that was after we declared an emergency and the area was cleared.    after we landed i pulled off the runway, had the fire crew visually inspect the aircraft and check with a heat gun to verify there was no presence of fire. after i determined it was safe i proceeded to the gate and let the passengers off. i wrote up the indications as well as an overweight landing. we flew the plane back to [a different station] and the same thing happened but only briefly. i wrote it up [again]. maintenance changed a module in the detection system [after the first occurrence] and i don't know what they did to it [after the second occurrence].     suggestions for this type of emergency; the checklist was way too long. for fire close to departing airport i would like to see a quick reference guide for runway distance and v speeds instead of having to do math on an already heavy workload.","an emb-145 captain reported experiencing a fire warning on #1 engine. they ran the procedure, shut down the engine, declared an emergency, and returned to departure airport where a module in the detection system was changed. same problem occurred on the next leg."
15,"on descent in to sun, passing approximately fl180, atis was obtained. i checked in with salt lake center, advised them we had the atis, and requested the rnav/gps 31 w menin transition. we were cleared down to 11,000. passing approximately 13,000 we were cleared for the rnav/gps 31 w, routing only, maintain 11,000. inside of oreye we were cleared to 9,000. we called the field in sight and were cleared for the visual approach to 31. atc advised us that a metroliner was not talking to him but said tower was, was off to our left and would follow us. we both looked at the tcas and saw the target at about our 10 o'clock position and 5 miles. descending through 10,000 we received a ta immediately followed by a ra. the pilot flying complied with the ra and i advised center we were in a \tcas climb.\ center asked us if we could continue the approach and i said no. we were then cleared back to 11,000 and to make a left 360 to re-acquire to field for a visual. rolling out on a 350 heading we called the field again and were cleared for a visual approach to 31. center switched us over to tower. we checked in with tower and were asked for our dme from the field which i reported as 12. he asked us to report a 5 mile final. he then asked the metroliner to report his dme, i believe it was 12 or 13. at this time the target on our tcas went back to amber. tower then initially used our call sign, he later corrected it to the metroliner, to instruct the metroliner to \slow to minimum approach speed for separation from the citation and report the traffic in sight.\ the metro said he didn't have the traffic in sight and was asked to execute a right 360. only then did the target on our tcas turn back to cyan. at no time during this event did we visually acquire the traffic. at approximately 6 dme the tower cleared us to land. on the roll out we were asked to expedite to b4 as the metroliner was on a two mile final. we cleared the runway at b4 and taxied to the ramp uneventfully. coordination between center and tower is critical. this is even more critical at mountainous airports located in tight valleys with little room to work with. this lack of communication put two aircraft at the same point, at the same time. without tcas this could have been a very bad situation.","corporate traffic inbound to sun described a tcas ra event with pattern traffic, the reporter noting the event was apparently triggered because of a breakdown of communication between the center (zlc) and sun tower."

18,"upon takeoff from runway 23 i had a gradual loss of engine power beginning at about 300 ft. my first thought was that i was experiencing fuel starvation, so i confirmed that the fuel cutoff valve was still in the open position and that the throttle and mixture were still full forward. i then executed a steep 180 degree turn to the left and landed on the flat ground in front of the new, still unopened atc tower, about 250 ft from runway 23.     the landing was uneventful, with no injuries to myself and no damage to the aircraft. the engine, which was still turning over slowly, died after the plane came to a stop. after about a minute, i attempted a restart, and the engine started immediately. i taxied across the flat ground until i could get onto runway 23 to cross it to the taxiway, and then returned to the tie down area to determine what to do next.    prior to this incident i had flown in from my home base and parked the plane near the avionics shop for reinstallation of a radio that they had cleaned and retuned. i returned to the plane about an hour later. i did not sump the fuel tanks and lines at that time because i had done that prior to the inbound flight. i taxied to runway 23 and did a run-up, which was normal. my engine analyzer showed normal temperatures during the run-up.    after the incident, i did several run-ups to 2400 rpm, but there was no sign of what caused the engine loss. i checked under the cowling but everything was in place. i sumped the fuel tanks and lines, but found no contaminants. i then asked the service manager at the fbo to have a mechanic check the plane.    after a few hours, the service manager told me that two mechanics with long experience in general aviation had given the plane a close inspection, including a compression check of the engine and a complete review of the fuel system. the only discrepancy they had found was a mud dauber nest well inside the fuel vent tube under the left wing. they cleared the obstruction and checked to see that the engine was running correctly.    once the plane was returned to me, i did a normal run-up and departed. the return flight was uneventful.    a blockage of the vent tube would explain the gradual decrease in engine power, especially since the engine was drawing maximum fuel for takeoff at full throttle, mixture rich and the nose was at a steep angle upward. i thought that the vents in the fuel tank caps were supposed to ensure fuel flow if the vent tube became blocked, but this does not appear to be the case. they may have been designed only to keep the fuel tanks from crumbling if a vacuum built up inside. if so, a fuel vent tube blockage represents a single point of failure.    i later looked for more information about mud daubers to see if they can build a nest in less than an hour and in what season they are active. i plan to get a pipe cleaner or wire to poke into the vent tube during preflight to check for blockage. i may also use some lightweight screening material to make a vent tube cover for while the plane is on the ground.    i cannot say for certain why it came into my mind to return to the airfield for landing. i knew that i had a large expanse of flat open ground to my left as i was taking off, and i rolled out of the steep left turn after 180 degrees, not the 270 degrees i would have needed to make it to the runway. although i did not consciously choose the open ground as a landing spot, i accepted it as a suitable place as i rolled out of the turn.    i may have stalled the plane during the turn, because i found after i came out of the turn that i was in a dive, had pulled the yoke back to its rear stop, and had no elevator effectiveness. the ailerons, however, had remained effective enough for me to end the turn. while i was thinking about what to do to recover from the dive - keep the yoke back or push it forward - the elevator began to take effect and the plane leveled off. my decision to turn back was influenced in part by my reading a recommendation to perform a steep turn if turning back and by my having practiced steep turns because of this recommendation. i imagine that if i had practiced lowering the nose and looking ahead for a landing place, i might have done that.",when his engine started to lose power shortly after takeoff the pilot of a c-152 elected to attempt to turn back to the runway but was unable to do so and landed on flat ground still on the airport proper.
19,"i changed my squawk to vfr and changed to ctaf, reporting 10 miles out and then reporting left downwind for runway 20. there was a learjet on the frequency approaching from the west, subsequently reporting right base for runway 20. a helicopter, not landing at the airport, reported west of the airport and transiting the area. i picked up the lear visually and extended my downwind slightly in order to follow it to the runway. i reported such over the unicom frequency. i thought that the helicopter had reported both the lear and myself in sight and wrongly assumed that he would cross the airport clear of the traffic pattern. although i was searching for the helicopter, i did not see it.     when i was about 300-400 agl and established on final my passenger saw the helicopter low and to our right and pointed it out to me at which time i pulled up hard to go above the helicopter. without the evasive action we would have passed very close. i made a radio call announcing that i was maneuvering to avoid the helicopter. the helicopter announced on the radio that he had me in sight. the helicopter pilot had chosen a very bad location to cross the final approach course. he was aware of the runway in use and that there were at least two airplanes, the lear jet and myself, approaching the airport.    although i had flight planned for this flight and realized that there was right traffic for runway 20, by the time i entered the traffic pattern i had forgotten and entered the left downwind. only three days later when i was wondering why the lear had made a \non-standard\ right base did i remember that i was the one who was non-standard when flying a \standard\ left hand pattern.","a pa32 pilot, mistakenly flying a left hand vice the published right hand pattern at an non-towered airport experienced an nmac with a helicopter on short final."

22,"i was providing ojti on north radar. the traffic and complexity was moderate. an adjacent facility, requested release of an ifr aircraft. the trainee released the aircraft on the sid. a few minutes later the aircraft, a pa28, checked in and said \approach the pa28 with you at 010\. the mva for that area is 016. the pilot's flight plan had his requested altitude at 100. the trainee did not give altitude restrictions to the tower for the pa28. as per our agreement, if no restrictions are given the pilot is expected to climb to requested altitude or fl200, whichever is lower. after the aircraft checked in at 010 the trainee asked him to \ident\. he then went to another aircraft to issue control instructions. he observed the \ident\ feature and told him radar contact. the trainee went back to the pa28 to issue him a vector northbound to separate from departing ifr aircraft from another airport. we had lost mode c for a few sweeps and when it re-acquired, he was still at 010. a low altitude alert flashed on the scope and the trainee gave him the low altitude alert instructions. only after that, it appeared that the pa28 stayed at 010 until further clearance from approach. the trainee then climbed him to 100. the trainee did not verify his assigned altitude upon initial call-in. the pilot simply said he was \at 010\. however, as the trainer, i missed some key factors to this situation as it was unfolding. i was looking at other problematic areas on the scope that i thought needed attention as well. it does not excuse my inability to catch this mistake as it was unfolding as well.,a pa28 departed ifr on a north departure (heading 300), when he checked in, he reported \at 1,000\. normally, ifr departures are assigned their filed altitude or fl200, whichever is lower. in this case, he was supposed to be climbing to 10,000. he failed to check in with his assigned altitude, and i neglected to verify it. i was monitoring his position reference the neighboring airport's departure corridor off of runway 33, where departures climb on a 300 heading as well. he appeared to be encroaching upon a 33 departure, so i assigned him a heading of 350 to get him away from the departure. i was under the impression that that heading was within the pdva (diverse vector area). as he began the northbound turn, i noticed that he was still at 1,000. i asked him to verify that he was assigned 10,000. he replied that he was level at 1,000. a low altitude alert then sounded from the stars. i issued the low altitude alert and climbed him to 10,000. i would recommend that the north departure off of the airport be changed to a heading of 320, giving 20 degrees of divergence from the neighboring airport's departure corridor. i gave the vector because i was worried about maintaining separation from the neighboring airport's departures. i later found that the pdva for the airport on the given runway for a right turn was 330. thus, my misunderstanding of the pdva caused me to vector the pa28 below the mva. to prevent this from happening in the future, i will ensure that i am fully aware of the pdva's for all the airports in my airspace, as well as paying special attention to ensuring that i get a correct read back of altitude assignments.",tracon controller described a below mva event when an ifr departure from a satellite airport failed to climb as expected per procedure.

35,"while departing teterboro airport in day vmc conditions on the ruudy 4 rnav departure, we exceeded our initial level-off altitude of 1,500 ft by 160 to 180 ft (copilot's altimeter vs. pilot's altimeter.) at approximately 800 ft we received a tcas ta alert and noted an amber target about 3 miles behind us and 1,200 ft above us. i have been flying in and out of teterboro for 27 years and am very aware of the critical need to not bust that 1,500 ft mandatory altitude when departing runway 24 due to the proximity of arriving newark traffic over-flying our departure path. further, having availed ourselves of training videos for the pilot community utilizing teterboro, we were aware that most level busts on our departure route occur on spectacular vmc days just like the one we had on departure. as a result the crew thoroughly briefed the departure procedure. so what happened? one factor was that we were very light due to the short leg and the desire to land at destination as light as possible due to our destination's short runway (5,090 ft). next, due to the length of teterboro runway and noise abatement consideration/procedure, we utilized rated takeoff power (maximum power), autothrottles, and flaps 20 degrees. as a result we had great takeoff and climb performance. in our brief this was noted as both a strength and a weakness; a strength as it related to runway required and noise abatement performance and a weakness in terms of our need to level off at 1,500 ft. this was discussed and it was determined we would take two actions to address this weakness. the first was to leave the flaps at 20 degrees until after we were cleared above 2,000 ft (the second altitude restriction) in order to decrease the workload on the pilot not flying. the second mitigation strategy was to engage the autopilot at 500 ft to let it perform the level off. that turned out to be a mistake. every time i had executed that departure in the past i had done so manually with no problems. however, in this case i was attempting to see if utilizing the autopilot to decrease our workload would allow us to better monitor the level off. initially all went well as the autopilot was engaged at 500 ft and the aircraft immediately began its level off. unfortunately, with our performance, it was quickly evident the autopilot was not going to keep us below 1,500 ft. upon realizing this i disconnected the autopilot and autothrottles while abruptly reducing thrust to idle and pushing over to minimize the altitude exceedences. there was no communication from approach regarding the bust. in fact i'm not sure it qualified as an official bust. the purpose of the asrs report is to bring to the communities attention the downside of utilizing the vnav climb function when leveling off so soon after takeoff, especially if you are very light. the departure procedure calls for a level off at 1,500 ft until passing a close in intersection and then climbing to maintain 2,000 ft by the next intersection. we discussed whether or not to \back ourselves up\ by putting 1,500 ft in the altitude window of the flight guidance panel or putting 2,000 ft in the window and allowing vnav to fly the departure. we had become very confident in the vnav automation function and decided to put 2,000 ft in the window after verifying 1,500 ft was indicated in the fms and on the pfd. in the end, due to our light takeoff weight and early level off requirement, i believe we put the autopilot in a position it simply was not designed to handle. in the future i will stick to using what has worked when performing a critical maneuver while utilizing the simulator to test, and perfect, any new procedures.","after departing on the teb ruudy 5 rnav, the captain of a gv engaged the autopilot at 500 ft, but exceeded 1,500 ft by about 180 ft, so the autopilot was disconnected and the aircraft returned the constraint."

46,"i was working final monitor west when an e170 checked in on the frequency out side of the approach fix. he went through the localizer to the east and the fma went off. i told him he appeared to be east of the localizer and to turn right and return to the localizer immediately. he replied that he showed himself on it and asked if he should turn 5 or 10 degrees right to rejoin. i told him however much he needed to turn right and return to the localizer. while this was going on i was trying to coordinate with the other monitors that were sitting next to me that he was rejoining. then i noticed he was descending. at that point i thought the approach was unsafe so i broke him out to the west and told him to maintain 4,000 since he was already through 4,600. i then coordinated with the final for how they wanted him back. i told him to fly heading 270 and noticed he was at 4,700. i asked him whether he was climbing or descending. he said climbing so i told him to maintain 5,000 and re-coordinated with the final. after i switched him, i noticed he went down to 4,000 anyway. i'm not sure how close the aircraft was to the other aircraft on approach to parallel runways since i was using the fma and it has a magnification so it is very hard to determine distances.,this was a part 121 operation. we were being vector for the ils 18r approach. we were at 4,000 ft msl when approach control gave a 150 degree heading to intercept the localizer for 18r. i was on autopilot in hdg mode but i was in pink needles because we were about 25 miles out from the runway. i turned the heading bug to 150, selected nav, and the plane began to turn. while in the turn approach cleared us for the ils 18r; i then went and hit the app mode. i then for some reason decided to hit the v/l button to go to green needles but mistakenly pressed the prev button which switched my preview from loc 2 to loc 1. so, i realized it and immediately pressed it again to switch me back to loc 2. by doing this caused the approach mode to deactivate. i did not notice that at first. the localizer came alive and started moving left to right. that was normal. a few seconds past then the needle was at center but the plane had not begun the turn to intercept. that is when i notice the loc/gs was not active on the panel. i pressed the a/p disc button instead of the tcs and started banking the plane back to the right to re-intercept the loc. while doing so i allowed the altitude to begin descending, about 200 ft. i applied back pressure to the yoke and stop the descent but never climbed back up to 4,000. i re-intercepted the loc and re-gauge the autopilot and armed the approach. the airplane began to turn to the left again. getting us off a 1/2 dot deviation. atc queried us if we were on the loc and the captain responded yes. while he was taking to atc; i disconnected the autopilot again and turned the airplane to the right to get back on course. this caused me again to lose about 100 ft of altitude. then atc told us approach clearance was cancelled and to turn right to 270. i turn the plane to 270 and then re engage the autopilot. with that the plane started to bank to the left to intercept the loc. i again disconnected the autopilot and turn the plane back to the right. i was no more than 5 degrees off the 270 heading assigned. trying to figure out why the plane was doing that realized i did not command heading when atc instructed us to turn to 270. that would cause the captain to press the hgd button and engage heading mode. so, i commanded heading and autopilot on. atc then gave us any turn and a climb to 5,000 ft msl. i turned the alt selector knob to 5,0, said \5,000 set\ and pressed flight level change button. the aircraft took a longer time than normal to climb. that's probably because my mind is going a thousand mile per minute because of what had taken place. so, i again took control and placed the plane in a climbing attitude and then press the autopilot button. we got re-vectored for the approach without incident and landed. while taxiing in, we heard another plane have problem with tracking the loc. we parked at the gate and called maintenance.,we were being vectored onto ils 18r localizer. while on the localizer, the centerline needle began to sway erratically. the first officer (pilot flying) made a correction and reset the autopilot, which began turning in the opposite direction of localizer course (autopilot turned away from the needle). first officer clicked the autopilot off and corrected course manually; in doing so he deviated from his altitude. upon regaining ils 18r centerline needle indicator, we were told that we were left of course with the centerline needle of the ils centered. approach control vectored us off the ils to come back around and fly it again. we did so and landed in clt uneventfully. at the time of the incident, there was pilot error in the altitudes maintenance during the corrective action. as of now, i am uncertain what caused the navigation anomaly;

48,"when we arrived at the aircraft about 1 hour prior to departure, fueling was in progress. i did the walk around, then noticed the fuel truck was still in position but disconnected. in the cockpit i sat in the second observer's seat to do a more detailed logbook review and sign the log page. while i was doing this the first officer commented that our fuel load was not symmetrical. on looking at the fuel synoptic, all main tank quantities were boxed in yellow and both tank 1 and 4 and 2 and 3 fuel imbalance eicas messages were displayed. we called maintenance. the approximate quantities were: center = 7.0, #1 main = 22.0, #2 main = 56.0, #3 main = 48.0, #4 main = 17.0, #2 reserve = 5.0, #3 reserve = 0.0. total fob = 155.0.     the [span wise] aom imbalance limitations are: tanks 1 vice 4 = 3.0 tanks 2 vice 3 = 6.0. also, no center tank fuel is allowed until all main and reserve tanks are full unless the center tank fuel is counted as payload. my thought was to have maintenance transfer fuel so the center tank was empty and tanks one through four were balanced. this was not to be since the mechanic was not familiar with the transfer procedure. to try and keep things simple, i asked them to add fuel so tanks 1-4 were balanced and to rerun the weight and balance to reflect this and to include the center tank fuel as payload. this would require the addition of about 18,000 lbs of fuel.     i then called dispatch and explained our solution and request a revised flight plan. so far so good, except in the heat of battle i missed the very last bullet point in the aom fuel loading limitations that the center tank scavenge system must be deactivated when carrying ballast fuel. to avoid this omission in the future, it makes sense to locate this limit in the same paragraph that requires center tank fuel to be counted as payload when all main and reserve tanks are not full.     we continued the cockpit setup and soon the load supervisor appeared and asked if the fuel load was ok. all was as requested, except reserve tank 3 was indicating 3.0 instead of the 5.0 requested. i asked if the fuel truck was still hooked up and was told \i don't think so.\ i replied it was ok; we would not need additional fuel. at this point, the gateway called saying they had no way to add the center tank fuel as payload. all they had was an entry for balance control fuel (bcf). i told them that was the place. it turns out bcf is added to the zfw on the matrix and on the acars weight and balance page. however, the togw number is derived by adding payload + bow (basic operating weight) + fuel. this is correct from a weight standpoint, but it is not the way the aircraft's fmc perf page works. the fmc derives togw by adding zfw and fuel. this counts bcf twice; once as part of the zfw and once as part of the fuel load. this caused a good 15-20 minutes of confusion while we tried to understand why the fmc gross weight was approximately 10.0 greater than the weight and balance program togw. the first officer figured out the payload + bow + fuel issue and then i finally caught the approximately 10.0 number was bcf + taxi fuel.     we had operations run the weight and balance again without a bcf entry and everything fell into place, but it is not technically correct. even though 7,000 lbs is about 1% of our togw and likely gets caught in the data scatter, the system integration between the weight and balance program and the fmc has a bug in this area that needs to be addressed. also, there needs to be a caution by the bcf entry that the center tank scavenge systems must be deactivated when bcf is used. this caution and the bcf amount should be presented on the printout provided to the captain. our 7,000 lbs is trivial regarding cg movement, but 70,000 or 100,000 lbs would be a different story. additional confusion resulted from the fueler not getting closer on the fuel in reserve tank 3. the 2,000 lbs difference threw us out of the matrix resulting in discussions with operations and dispatch before the final weight and balance was printed and signed. we blocked out 46 minutes late.",when the fuelers failed to load the required fuel as required for weight and balance compliance the flight crew of a b747-400 was forced to improvise an increase in fuel volume and location that would correct the errors. upon doing so they failed to recognize and implement the required deactivation of the center tank fuel scavenge system.

69,"the controller declared an emergency on my behalf because i entered imc under vfr and was not able to give me a clearance because i was below the mva. i had just transitioned a class c airport's airspace southbound over the bay to land at a nearby class d airport. the class c airport was vfr. my destination had just gone ifr with bkn008. i was flying traffic watch and the previous traffic watch pilot informed us that they had just landed at my destination under special vfr. i told class c's tower that it was my intention to land at my destination under special vfr. i was surprised that the tower handed me off to approach instead of the class d tower. i learned later on the ground that they also did not tell approach of my intentions. when the approach controller gave me a vector across the class c airport's final approach, i assumed that was the reason and they would then pass me to my destinations tower. i learned on the ground that approach thought i was going to continue traffic watch southbound down the interstate. approach asked me to maintain vfr. i was watching the clouds carefully because on the assigned vector, i would be in the broken layer in a few minutes. i had my destination in sight about 5 miles away off to my left. then the controller asked me if i wanted to continue down the interstate, which surprised me, but i responded that i was going to my destination. the controller pointed out that my destination had just gone below minimums, which i knew. at that point i should have reiterated that i wanted to request special vfr at my destination. i am not sure whether i did point that out to the controller, but since i was on a vector away from my destination and the conditions were deteriorating, i instead requested the localizer approach into my destination. the controller asked me to standby and maintain vfr. i set up the instruments for the localizer approach. about a minute later i could see the approach course for my destination coming onto the gps; my vector was perpendicular to the approach. right as i crossed the approach course i told the controller that i was crossing the approach course and asked if i he was going to turn me. i thought he might have forgotten about me due to the busy class c airport's arrivals. the controller again reiterated for me to remain vfr. i said unable to maintain vfr. this is where the controller asked if i was going imc and i responded yes. being familiar with the rising terrain ahead, i said i needed to climb immediately and began a max rate climb. the controller asked if i was declaring an emergency and i responded negative, i did not feel that i had an emergency because i was instrument current, the aircraft was ifr certified and i was in control of the aircraft. the controller said he was declaring an emergency on my behalf and instructed me to climb to 4,000 ft. i got on top at 3,500 ft and notified the controller. he vectored me around for a while for the class c airport's traffic sequencing, and then cleared me for the approach [into my destination]. the rest of the flight proceeded without further incident. after the flight, i spoke with a supervisor at approach who indicated that even when on a vector, if instructed to maintain vfr, the pilot must do whatever is necessary to maintain vfr, even if that means reversing course. i did not reverse course at the time because the controller had just vectored me through the final approach course of the class c airport and i felt that if i reversed course into the class c airport's final that i would have created a serious separation problem. my error was going imc without a clearance, especially below the mva, because i learned that atc cannot issue an ifr clearance below the mva. my other error was not clarifying my intentions with the controller early enough so that they had a chance to coordinate. the fact that class c tower did not relay my intentions on to the approach controller contributed to the confusion, but in marginal vfr and busy airspace i need to leave myself and the controller more time to handle the situation. not acting sooner put the controller in a difficult situation. it also put me into a potential controlled flight into terrain situation. the instruction \maintain vfr\ must be followed, even if on an assigned vector or if it means crossing a final approach path.","vfr traffic watch aircraft encountered imc conditions after being instructed to maintain vfr, weather, higher terrain, mva minimums and atc failed coordination all playing a part in this event, resulting in an atc declared emergency."

93,"we were operating flight scheduled service. the flight was late arriving and it was our last flight of the day during night conditions. we had 103 passengers onboard. after pushback we were cleared to taxi to runway 15r, then cleared to takeoff runway 15r. normal takeoff until we saw at least two large waterfowl illuminated by the lighting from the landing lights. i was the pilot flying and reacted, but the closure rate was too fast to avoid a collision. the large waterfowl, most likely canadian geese, struck the aircraft on the left side and we had a loud bang followed by increased engine vibration and changes in our engine parameters. we knew we took at least one in the #1 engine immediately. also, we had a master caution light illuminate with an eng indication. the captain notified atc and declared that we were coming back to land, needing assistance upon landing for an operational emergency. i continued as the pilot flying while the captain assessed the situation and brought out the qrh to run the inop checklist. during the bird strike, we had a high engine vibration of 4.0 units. upon level off, i made sure that the engine parameters were still within limits and the all parameters were stabilized with the engine vibration under 3.0 units at 3,000 ft msl and 210 kts. the captain notified the flight attendants, atc, company, and passengers of our situation and after our checklists were complete, we told atc we were ready for an approach to runway 10. the captain asked if i was still comfortable with the landing and i said, yes i was. we again notified tower that we wanted the fire trucks to check out the aircraft and brakes upon landing. we landed flaps 30 with the #1 engine pulled back slightly and taxied off the runway into the deice pad so the fire trucks could check the condition of the aircraft. after a small cool down, the captain shut down the number one engine and coordinated with the rescue team. they communicated that the number one engine had significant damage and that the brakes were approximately 120 degrees. we landed 1,000 lbs below maximum landing weight and there were no brake limit cooling from the performance calculations. i communicated with operations, flight attendants, and passengers about our event and our instructions. we were cleared from the fire rescue team and taxied back to the gate. i think our entire crew handled this event with good crm and teamwork. tracon handled our situation great and it was nice to have good controllers handling us. our flight attendants kept the passengers calm under a possible stressful event. our fire rescue team was in excellent position for us to taxi off the runway and for them to assess our aircraft. my captain handled this event calmly, under control, and with professionalism. i think under non-normal events it is great to have good communications and crm amongst all the members to conduct the flight safely.,[narative #2 had no additional information.]","at least one goose entered a b737-300's left engine at 1,800 ft after takeoff causing a high engine vibration reading and the eng light so the crew declared an emergency, completed the qrh and returned to the departure airport."
94,"i believe there is an error in our company's acars runway data message system. the 4 of us have about 18 years experience on the 777 and have never seen t/o (takeoff) not possible, let alone 10 or more times. we all checked that every single entry was correct with the fm page. we asked dispatch for help and to get a 777 flight duty manager involved. dispatch sent nine different rwy data messages to us. the first was 38,400 lbs below actual final togw. i acars'ed back the large discrepancy error. he sent another for tog of 627.6 and i had to inform him again that our real final weights were 9,300 lbs higher!!!!! then we got 3 more at 638.4 even though final weights were 636.9. but the big problem i told him is we are still getting t/o not possible on our rwy data message and all of us agreed we needed to have acars rwy data agree with dispatch calculations so could he please find out why acars is still showing us for the 10th time t/o not possible. several minutes later acars rwy data finally came up and we were able to takeoff legally but after so many different gw numbers all claiming to be correct it's hard to believe they were but the plane handled normal and fuel burn was right on. if this carrier has changed some computer system recently in relation to acars or dispatch rwy data then an audit needs to be done because that many gross weight changes for no apparent reason is not right. i think i have most of the acars and dispatch messages printed although i could not print our outgoing messages to dispatch.",a b777 received nine t/o not possible fmc messages because the gross weight takeoff data from dispatch was incorrect and the captain questioned whether a company computer program had been modified.
95,"after landing on 26l [at iah], i was instructed to exit at taxiway nr. after exiting, ground first instructed us to taxi via na-ne-wa-to parking. after read back it was changed to nr-ww-wa-to parking. looking at diagram we appeared to be on ne, so i taxied straight ahead looking for ww. the intersection of nr and ww is not marked. after we passed it ground instructed us to continue and join wb to parking; which we did.",an air carrier captain advised that taxiway ww at nr is not marked at iah. as a result he missed the turn given by ground control after exiting runway 26l.
96,"descending into pdx via the moxie star we were cleared to cross seven miles south of vantz intersection at 10,000 msl. because of how unusual this clearance was (vantz at 10 or 12 thousand is the norm) i queried atc asking to confirm the clearance and atc responded that was correct. the pilot flying mistakenly set 7,000 into the altitude alerter and i mistakenly confirmed 7,000 as a correct altitude. we descended to 9,500 where we re-considered the clearance, briefly talked and decided to stop the descent. at this time atc asked our altitude. i explained we had become confused or misunderstood the clearance and were descending to 7,000 msl, 7 miles south of vantz. from there atc cleared us to descend and maintain 9,000. flight continued normally.    being initially confused by the clearance to cross seven miles south of vantz and then seeing 7,000 in the altitude window may have drawn an incorrect correlation resulting in a positive response in my mind because of the relation between the seven mile south restriction and seeing the \7\ recur in the altitude window. this is only educated guess to as why seeing 7 thousand set produced a positive response in my mind.     increased scrutiny of altitude set in the altitude alerter. even though the pilot not flying may initially concur with the pilot flying's altitude selection it doesn't necessarily mean that is the correct altitude. do not just agree with what digits are set in the window. make sure to agree that the proper altitude set.",an unusual crossing restriction from approach while descending on the moxie star to pdx led the flight crew of an emb-120 to descend below their cleared altitude.
97,"[this was a] skydiving flight; fuel exhaustion on final approach to land. pattern and approaches are always done very high, so some of the flaps were retracted, and a gliding landing was easily made. fueling was done for these 3 skydiving flights after flying the airplane from the home airport to the airport where the skydiving took place. fuel was checked in both tanks before leaving the home airport, and i mentally noted that one tank contained more fuel than the other, and that i had plenty of fuel to fly to the skydiving airport, and would get fuel there even if i did not fly skydivers. i think the reason this happened is that i forgot which of the tanks had the greater amount of fuel when checking fuel at the home airport. i therefore filled the tank that was already the most full, and did not have the reserve in the other tank as expected, because i did not specifically check it after filling the other tank. this also might have never been noticed if i had not used a steep bank from base to final. there is a large amount of unusable fuel in early model c182's, especially if steep banks are performed at lower fuel levels.",a c182 engine quit on final approach from fuel starvation after the pilot flew three skydiving flight and forgot that the selected tank did not have sufficient reserve fuel after using the other wing's full tank.
98,"upon returning to the cab, i was just about to plug in at the cic position in the back to start monitoring lc1 in anticipation of taking the position, and was facing away from the runways. i was not plugged in monitoring yet, but overheard the trainee instruct one aircraft to turn at a-7. i think he then told another aircraft to hold short of 29r, and appeared to be looking on final for traffic inbound to 29r. at the time, there were also multiple aircraft inbound to 29l. i then remembered seeing the trainee scanning the final for 29r, while the other flm (monitoring for the skill check from the other side of the cab) appeared to say that he could cross the traffic holding on b twy. right after the crossing instruction was issued, i heard multiple tower team members going \hold short, hold short\ for the cessna, and then multiple people as well as the instructor saying \go around, go around\ for the traffic on final. i saw that the cessna appeared to stop at or on the runway hold bars, with the saratoga airborne on the go-around over 29r. once the piper was no factor, the cessna was given crossing instructions. at this point, i plugged into the cic jack. after going around and making right traffic, the piper asked while he was on downwind for information about why he was issued go around and the trainee explained about the cessna's crossing clearance on b twy. though i returned to the cab only briefly prior to the event occurring, i believe that some confusion and conflicting instructions led up to this event taking place. i'm not sure if the flm performing the skill check didn't see the traffic on final for 29r, or maybe thought that it was traffic was for 29l, but either way, i think it was an honest mistake that unfortunately resulted in a distraction or lapse in awareness, and thus created a dangerous situation. the trainee perhaps thought that he was \missing something\ or that maybe the other more experienced flm saw the was sufficient time for the crossing, so he issued it. thankfully, as soon as the members of the tower team saw the dangerous situation with traffic short final, multiple people spoke up and both the ojti and trainee took immediate action to correct it with \hold short\ and \go around\ instructions.     this is a challenging issue because it's frequent that you're working a control position and other controllers are giving advice. almost always, the advice is helpful and ranges from a reminder about something minor to an urgent warning to correct a dangerous situation. these kinds of reminders and warnings are expected in an effective tower team environment and greatly enhance safety. other times, it seems the advice is to perform a task faster, not delay an aircraft, etc., and might also be warranted to help a controller through a potential overload situation. but as much as we try to help each other with good advice, it's essential that the cpc responsible for the position is fully aware of what's taking place and comfortable taking the action suggested. sometimes when there are multiple people in the tower cab, such as during an airshow or special event, conflicting suggestions can become a distraction.  my recommendation is that it's important to assist and accept assistance from others, but when you're the person ultimately responsible for the position, remember to use your tools (scanning, position reports, radar display, etc.) to confirm that you're certain taking the course of action someone else has suggested is safe.",tower controller described a go around event and expresses a number views concerning the interaction of other controllers in their attempt to assist and the distractions that easily result. 
99,"weather was vfr severe clear, pilots had been reporting the airport 20 miles out for the visual approach. a pa32 requested a no gyro asr approach. i know from experience that asr (airport surveillance radar) approaches are time consuming, especially no-gyro asr's. i worked to prepare my other traffic so i could devote more attention to the asr. i gave the pa32 vector to the runway 28 final and began no gyro vectors near the final. i was in the process of giving the pa32 the information, mda and other information. the asr to runway 28 has a step down approach procedure, 900 till 3 nm final and then 400 with a missed approach point 1 nm final. i was concentrating on giving all the information correctly but i also descended (gave the pilot the mda) of the pa32 early which conflicts with the mva. the low altitude alert went off. other controllers commented i was slow to respond since i did not think that the aircraft was in proximity to even warrant an alert. i realized later that switching between scopes to my right my perceived mileage even though it was monitoring it was incorrect. i thought the pa32 was near enough to the fix, descent to the mda should have started and continued with the approach. an unexpected vfr helicopter passed through the flight path of the pa32 and i did issue that traffic. the local controller had told me about traffic i just did not expect traffic to pass in front of my aircraft. the approach continued with the pa32 centered with the runway on the final. i did not get the pilots intentions for a touch and go until very late in the approach. the pa32 did a touch and go as a b737 departed before this aircraft. a cautionary wake turbulence call was probably necessary. i did not feel as confident working this approach as i use to feel when i worked them all the time. i generally work only about one a year for real, and not via simulator. i was not certain on how to phrase the step down mda so the pilot knew the information. give the asr approach duties to a stand alone position. prepare completely make necessary calls to tower about the approach to runway 28 sooner. ask pilot for his intentions and give tower the information. issue low altitude alerts. my actions for this situation were clumsy and slow. i am capable of much better.","tracon controller described the issuance of a \no gyro\ asr approach, noting his/her unfamiliarity with the procedure and failure to complete some required actions."

101,"we were given a descent to 13,000 ft. there were reports of moderate turbulence in the descent and the wind at the airport was gusting to 49 kts. we were discussing the landing conditions and turbulence. we descended through 18,000 ft. the current altimeter setting at den was 29.64. the captain set 29.64 in her window and i set 30.64 in my window. i called for the descent checklist. in the response of \altimeter and bugs,\ i glanced at the captain's window and saw .64 and looked at mine and saw .64 and verified crosschecked. we were experiencing moderate turbulence in the descent. i was slowing the descent down as i approached 13,000 ft. when the captain voiced, \aren't we supposed to be leveling at 13,000 ft, i immediately looked at her altimeter and then looked at the atis sheet and realized my altimeter was set incorrectly at 30.64 instead of 29.64. i stopped the descent and climbed back up to 13,000 ft. we had in fact reached 12,100 ft. the captain said to atc that we had gone below our assigned altitude and were climbing back up to the correct altitude.","a b737 first officer erroneously set his altimeter at 30.64 while the captain correctly set 29.64 and nearing 12,000 ft realized they have overshot the clearance altitude of 13,000 ft and corrected."
102,"we were on a visual approach to runway 06 at approximately 4,000 ft flying toward penne. we had a quartering tailwind on base and were ask to keep our speed up for traffic to follow us. at approximately 3,000 ft with the airport in sight we began a turn toward hunee descending to the glide slope intercept altitude of 1,800 ft. with the speed brake extended we had a pretty high rate of descent. i was in the terrain mode and checked my hsi to see if there was any terrain to be aware of. the only terrain depicted was off to our left and passing behind us. at approximately 2,100 ft and approximately 4.0 nm from hunee we received a terrain warning. the pilot flying began an immediate cfit maneuver and climbed to 2,400 ft. the warning ceased as soon as we began the maneuver. we intercepted the loc/gs and made a normal landing. i believe that the combination of our ground speed and descent rate triggered the egpws event. i really think that when approaching bdl from the west/southwest you need to always intercept at/outside of penne no lower than 3,000 ft.,on approach to bdl, visual approach, 5 miles south of the glide slope intercept, 40 kt tailwind, 250 kias, (traffic right behind us on approach), speedbrakes open, approaching loc/gs intercept, we got a \terrain-pull-up\ warning. lesson learned; get slow a bit earlier, especially with the big tailwind, and it will lessen the terrain closure, and maybe intercept glide slope a bit higher/further out, and the cfit warning should not be a factor.","a flight crew reported an egpws terrain, pull up warning at about 2,100 ft on a night visual approach to bdl runway 6 because of a high rate of descent to the glide slope altitude eight miles from the runway."

106,"flight boarded uneventfully with nothing unusual with the preflight and boarding process. at the end of the pushback, somehow the tow bar became disconnected from the nose gear. the nose gear free caster and was out of position when we came to a stop and the tow bar must have bumped against the nose gear at the same time before coming to a stop. the captain set the brake and asked ground personnel what happened. the tug operator told us the tow bar became disconnected and the nose wheel spun around. the captain asked if anything had broken and the ground crew responded with no, but the nose wheels had spun around. the captain told the ground crew to use the tow bar to reposition the nose wheels to the correct position for connecting the scissors. after discussing what to do, then we decided an inspection of the nose gear before departing would be prudent. the captain elected to inspect the nose gear for damage and i stayed on the flight to ride the brakes. we contacted the flight attendant informing her of what had happened. then i made a pa to the passengers about the pushback and the captain going outside to inspect the nose gear. the captain exited the aircraft and inspected the nose gear along with several ground personnel. upon completion of the inspection the captain and ground personnel had not detected any structural damage to the aircraft. after the inspection was completed the captain made the decision to continue with the flight. we called ground for taxi and started taxiing to the runway. the captain made note that the rudder petals and the nose wheel steering operated normally, no different than our previous flights in that aircraft. ground control informed us of a hold for release time of a half hour. i completed a pa to the passengers and talked to the flight attendant about the wheels up time. ten minutes prior to release we restarted engines and continued taxiing to the runway. after departing the positive rate, gear up calls were made. i selected the gear up and we received two master warning messages. the qrh procedures were followed for nose door open and gear disagree. the nose gear indicated down and green with both main gear up and locked. we checked the landing distance from the flight standards manual, declared an emergency, and notified the station of our return. after completing all checklists, discussing the overweight landing and checking the numbers, talking to the flight attendant, making a pa to the passengers, we completed a normal landing in the normal landing configuration back at the departure airport. after clearing the runway, we had fire and rescue inspected the outside of the aircraft and the nose gear for a leaking fluid or any noticeable damage and they reported the aircraft looked fine with no apparent damage. after the report from fire and rescue we taxied back to the gate and disembarked the passengers. the captain then called maintenance and entered the write ups in the logbook. contract maintenance arrived and talked with maintenance control to start trouble shooting the problem and later stated that he would not have noticed the damage had he not been told to specifically inspect the sensor lines. develop procedures that ensure the tow bar is connected correctly, and or routine inspections of tow bars for worn or damaged parts that can cause this problem while repositioning aircraft. also make pilots and ground personnel more aware of how easily wiring on the landing gear can be damaged with no easily noticeable markings.,we were on a spot on the ramp which allowed me to go out and inspect the nose gear myself. along with ramp agents, i looked everything over; the assembly, the tires and wheels. nothing appeared abnormal. there were no broken wires, fluid leaks or apparent damage. the nose gear had castered around so the ramp agents retrieved another tow bar to straighten the gear and re-connect the steering \scissors\. i returned to the cockpit and we informed the flight attendant and passengers of the situation. i also briefed the first officer on what i saw, and if there was the slightest indication of a problem during taxi out, that we would return to the gate. the taxi and take-off were normal. on initial climb when the first officer selected gear-up, we received \nose door open\ and \gear disagree\ warning messages. we continued the climb to 3,000 ft. we informed atc that we had a landing gear problem and needed time to troubleshoot the situation.    in retrospect i thought that taking the extra step of inspecting the nose gear myself instead of taking the ramp agent's word for it would suffice. afterward, however i now realize there were additional resources i should have taken advantage of: 1) since the first officer has done many more walk-arounds than i have, i should have had him inspect it also, to get his opinion. 2) another resource would have been to have the local contract maintenance technician inspect the nose gear. later while talking to the technician that did come out, he stated that he most likely would have missed the damage also. not until after our maintenance control instructed the local maintenance technician on what to look for, was he able to recognize the damage.","a crj200 became disconnected from the tow bar at the pushback's end and the nose wheel spun. the captain found no damage after examining it and they departed only to have the nose gear not retract, so an emergency was declared and the flight returned to the departure airport."

108,"after about 1 hour in cruise and just prior to oceanic coast out, the captain and i both noticed an electrical burning odor in the cockpit. after executing the proper procedure in the qrh, the relief pilot and #1 flight attendant called the cockpit to advise of a motor noise in the forward galley. after declaring an emergency and turning the aircraft around, the odor and noise both seemed to dissipate. a short time later the #1 flight attendant called again to tell us that the reading lights in the cabin were all flashing on and off. at this point, we were very concerned with the electrical deterioration of our aircraft. while dumping fuel, all three pilots were in the flight deck running checklists, talking to dispatch, coordinating with our flight attendants, coordinating with atc, and planning a divert to the nearest airport. fuel was dumped down to about 14,000 ft and radar vectors commenced with a flawless arrival and overweight landing. we cleared the runway and had airfield rescue and firefighter looks us over. after given an all clear, we taxied to an open gate for deplaning. i would like to commend both the captain and relief pilot for their outstanding teamwork and procedures in handling this emergency. maintenance discovered the exhaust fan in the e&e compartment overheated when the bearings failed. the flashing reading lights was a result of that overheat in a common bus. an alarm/sensor in the e&e compartment in that area would help to alert the pilots and possibly prevent a tragedy in the future.,[narrative #2 had no additional information.],i was the relief pilot in seat when i felt a strong vibration and noise just forward of my seat. as i got up out of my seat, i was met by the number 5 flight attendant who was coming to get me concerning the vibration and noise. she told me that she had turned off the ovens but the vibration and noise continued. i called the cockpit, related the vibration/noise and they told me that they had a strong electrical odor in the cockpit. i went up to the flight deck and the electrical smell was very strong. the captain and i then completed the checklist in the qrh while the first officer flew the aircraft. i verified that no circuit breaker's had popped. i called back to the purser who told me the vibration/noise had not ceased. i returned back to the galley and verified that the noise/vibration had not ceased but after being there for 30 seconds, the vibration/noise ceased and the in-flight entertainment also stopped working. i returned to the cockpit and informed the captain. the captain decided that a return to the departure airport was prudent; as did the other pilots and that we would be flying over a major airport if anything else developed. within 3 minutes, a coach flight attendant called and told me that the smoke alarm in the aft lavatory and gone off twice for a split second. i left the cockpit and went to the aft lavatory and verified that the alarm was not going off and that no smoke was present. i then observed that all the coach reading lights were flickering. i called the captain from the aft galley and told him of this new issue and my desire to land as soon as possible. once in the cockpit, fuel dumping was begun as we started our descent to a nearby airport. fuel dump was secured at 6,000 ft. upon landing, the fwd ext fan eicas message was presented and the respective cb popped. the overweight landing was smooth with minimum brakes used. the crash crew checked the aircraft for hot spots/hot brakes after we cleared the runway. with nothing hot or burning we taxied to the gate. as the forward entry door was opened at the gate, the firemen on the jetbridge commented on the strong electrical odor that they could smell coming from the inside of the aircraft.",a b767-300 e&e compartment exhaust fan failed in flight causing an electrical burning smell and the coach reading lights to flicker so an emergency was declared and the flight diverted to a nearby international airport.
109,"on climb out i (first officer) happened to notice a wisp of smoke coming from under the acars area of the instrument panel. after a short time we began to smell a slight burning odor. we decided to return to the departure airport. the smoke and odor stopped. we continued to return, ran the qrh checklist and declared an emergency. we did an uneventful overweight landing. we entered both the overweight landing and smoke in the logbook.,[narative #2 had no additional information.]",a md82 crew returned to the departure airport after a wisp of smoke and an electrical odor appeared to come from the acars unit.
110,following electrical transfer got lvl 1 via 1 fault. shortly thereafter got a flashing cargo fire agent disch light. directed the first officer to ensure the cargo area was clear of personnel. this took approximately one minute. once he informed me the area was clear i executed the phase one's. had the first officer evacuate the jumpseaters and keep all ramp personnel away from the aircraft while i had informed the fire department (via the ramp tower) and maintenance. fire department inspected the cargo area with no evidence of fire; cargo trans-loaded to another aircraft. there was concern from a maintenance supervisor that the fire agent was discharged prior to ensuring the area was clear. the first officer confirmed that no personnel were present within a minute and then the agent was discharged. i believe there has been a considerable number of flashing disch lights upon power transfer. consideration should be given to modifying qrh in how we handle this type of issue (i.e. prior to block out and after block out).,"a dc10 lvl 1 via 1 fault occurred during the preflight electrical power transfer followed by a flashing cargo fire agent disch light so the captain had the aircraft evacuated, called the fire department and maintenance. no fire was evident and the qrh procedure may require modification."
111,"climbing out at about 15,000 ft a \stall fail\ caution message illuminated. we continued our climb and ran the appropriate qrh procedure. passing through fl310 the stick shaker began which disengaged the autopilot. we continued our climb while we addressed the problem and received a clearance from center at the time to maintain a block altitude of fl310-340. we were able to get the autopilot reengaged only to have it be kicked back off by the stick shaker a few more times. the stick shaker was on continuously at one point for around 5 minutes. with the autopilot off above fl290 we were in rvsm without an rvsm equipped aircraft. the shaker and low airspeed cues on my pfd went away through around fl330 at which point we were able to reengage the autopilot, climb and maintain fl340 and continue to our destination with no more problems. the root cause was the maintenance issue with the \stall fail\ caution. the qrh procedure was run and double checked. atc granted us a block altitude within rvsm. we were able to maintain positive control of the aircraft at all times and the extra altitude and time afforded us by being higher allowed us more time to troubleshoot if things continued to deteriorate. as the pilot not flying i could have vocalized the invalid low speed awareness cues that i was seeing on my pfd and which i assumed the captain was seeing as well, but apparently was not, that would have provided more of a warning to him of the stick shaker. assuming that the captain had the same indications on his pfd was a mistake. i could have increased communication on my part and possibly given more warning of the stick shaker. other than that i believe we handled it well, the block altitude was requested and granted to us while we troubleshot the problem. if we were not able to reengage the autopilot or the block altitude was not granted we would have descended out of rvsm airspace.","a crj700's stall fail caution alerted climbing through 15,000 and the stick shaker began at fl310 which disengaged the autopilot so atc issued a rvsm block altitude until the warning was overcome for normal flight."
112,"when passengers were deplaning they were complaining that the rear of the cabin was hot. captain checked temperature and noted it to be 85 degrees. captain came to aft to check controls and removed the flight attendant's control of temperature gauge. passengers boarded the aircraft and captain had called maintenance. captain again came back to aft to check if the temperature was better and noted one side of the air vent was blowing cold air while the other was blowing hot air. maintenance came on board to address the heating issue. passengers that boarded were now complaining of the heat. flight attendant a asked the captain who was on the jet bridge speaking with the gate agent, if we would be deplaning or should we open the aft doors for ventilation. the captain gave permission to open aft doors. flight attendant a came back and went to the l2 door. due to the forward doors being open still, the aft doors were disarmed. flight attendant b (me) watched as flight attendant a cross checked the l2 door, looking to make sure all indicators were clear and it was disarmed and the girt bar indicator was clear and she then opened the l2 door and put the safety strap across. flight attendant a then came and before i touched anything on the r2 door we both cross checked the door to make sure that all indicators were ok. the vent flap and lock handles were up so the indicators were clear, disarmed (green) and the girt bar indicator was clear. we both checked and then i grasped the assist handle and opened the door. upon getting the handle up there was a loud hissing and as the manual door assist took over the slide started to deploy. it unfurled all the way out. i put the safety strap across. flight attendant a went forward to inform the captain that the slide had deployed and i stayed in the back. after the captain was informed, the customer service agent came onto the aircraft and announced that the flight had been canceled and the passengers deplaned.",erj170 flight attendant describes an inadvertent slide deployment at the r2 door when the door is opened for aircraft cooling.
113,"i was leaving rfd, having been parked in a hangar [northeast of runway 19]. i was unfamiliar with the airport. i had picked up the atis and caught 1 or 25 as departing runways. when i called for my taxi clearance, i also asked for vfr flight following to be set up, and it was. after some confusion over the departure runways, i was offered, and accepted, progressive taxi to runway 25. that was a left turn from the hangar area down juliet? i didn't know how close i was, and when i saw foxtrot, i asked if i should go there. i was told no, runway 25 was my destination and i was at the end of 25. seeing hold short lines all over the place, my first concern was that i had crossed the hold short line, but the controller told me to do my run-up right there where i was. at that point i should have stopped, collected my thoughts, and reviewed the airport diagram, but i didn't. this is when my mind put me on the runway, but i was told to do the run-up so it was ok. in reality, i was still on a taxiway and had not had a runway incursion. given the clearance to depart, i was too quick and assumed the taxiway was the runway and proceeded to depart on the taxiway. the controller told me to \stop, stop\, which i did, and he explained that i had begun a departure on a taxiway. i was told to do a 180 on the taxiway and come back and depart at the end of runway 25. adding insult to injury, when told to switch to departure frequency i managed to stay on tower. calling departure i was informed that i was still on tower. during preflight, i had put tower frequency on both radios. they were both on the active. when going to departure, i switched radios but not the frequency. switching frequencies then put me with departure. the rest of the flight went well.    ground control at destination informed me that rfd requested that i call. i knew what they wanted, and felt really bad about the unpreparedness. i have read of these situations and never considered that i would put myself in one of them. i learned that it is quite possible for me to screw up, and that i need to be more rigorous at every airport and phase of flight. the ultimate cause was hurried confusion, unfamiliarity with the airport, my position on the airport, and not referring to the airport diagram when i was unsure of my position.",pa28 pilot reports confusion during taxi to runway 25 at rfd via taxiway j. thinking that taxiway f is the runway a takeoff is attempted before being told to stop by the tower and taxi back to the end of runway 25.

119,"a sabreliner 65 checked in northwest of the airport at 110 without an approach request. i attempted to clear the sabreliner 65 direct to the airport, and descend to 40 for a visual approach. i believe i transmitted three times without response. this would not have been an issue had i not lost communication capabilities previously that day. i attempted contact with the only other aircraft on frequency, a be23. he also did not respond. i believe i attempted twice. i went back and forth between the two while switching handsets and jacks to trouble shoot the problem, assuming it was a frequency issue. at some point it was established that both aircraft could communicate with me clearly. by that time, the sabreliner 65 was north of the airport and requesting vectors for an ils approach to runway 32r. i descended the sabreliner 65 to 40, and chose to put him on a right downwind rather than a left like i would have done had i had his request earlier. i issued the sabreliner 65 a heading of 120. he read back 110 which was fine with me, so i left it. the be23 was also on a right downwind for an ils approach to runway 32r, heading 140. my plan was to keep the sabreliner 65 at 40 and base the be23 to follow when there was appropriate spacing. both aircraft had additional approach requests following the first. i told the sabreliner 65\on departure, turn right heading 100, climb and maintain 30.\ he read back \heading 100, maintain 30.\ i did not notice the fact that he read it back as if it were current, rather than a future instruction. the sabreliner 65 continued his descent. since i had not applied merging target procedures, the sabreliner 65 did not know that the be23 was in front of him on the downwind, nor vice versa. he keyed up twice (to turn, and stop the descent of the sabreliner 65) without transmitting because my cic noticed the situation and wanted me to climb the citation. i told him to turn right heading 220 and maintain 35, his present altitude. i transmitted again to turn immediately and climb to 40. i know i had less than 3 miles, but i do not know how much separation was lost. use opposite downwinds. apply merging target procedures. wait until the aircraft is in a position (i.e., on final) that leaves less doubt to whether instructions are to be followed immediately or in the future. listen more carefully.",approach controller in training described a loss of separation event when failing to insure a clearance was understood and read back correctly.
120,"this information is based on what i viewed on a replay of my own position. first off, [runway] xxl, zzz southeast plan, is not the normal operation the area runs and is usually accompanied by strong compression which must be carefully watched the first couple of minutes to get a feel for how to run the finals to ensure best efficiency with appropriate spacing. the day of the occurrence i did my first few sessions on the outboards and didn't know exactly how the compression was affecting final, so that took my attention when i first assumed the position along with setting up my display. i received the briefing from the previous controller and i inherited 4 aircraft. aircraft a was on a 6 mile final. aircraft b was on a 10.5 mile final. a b747, aircraft c, was on a 15 mile final. aircraft d was on a modified dog leg for xxl. the three aircraft on final were, in my opinion and past experience, \tight\ so that was also taking my attention to ensure that no surprise compression would compromise spacing. a b737 was on approach to zzz1 ils runway yy and was approximately on a 13 mile final and was not on my frequency. i slowed aircraft a down for spacing for an aircraft on short final and shipped him to the tower. i then slowed the b747 down then i slowed down aircraft b then shipped aircraft b to the tower. i shipped the b747 on a 6 or 7 mile final. watching replay, i saw the b737 break off the approach, which i was told caused by an evasive maneuver to avoid wind shear, and climbed into an unsafe proximity to the b747. when the targets were on top of each other the b747 altitude was 3,000 ft and the b737 altitude was 4,000 ft. i was told the closest they got were 1.5 miles 700 ft. this was the first time i have ever seen that event happen before. the conflict alert did not go off and the b747 did not raise any concern about the b737 with regards to tcas. during the event i never observed the b737 begin its go around as i was preoccupied with assuming the position, setting up my display, ensuring spacing was appropriate on a \tight\ final and getting the aircraft on the modified base leg was in proper position to follow the heavy the b747. i did not receive any coordination from either the zzz1 radar final controller nor from zzz1 tower that the b737 was about to penetrate my airspace. the data block was never \pushed up\ to me to grab my attention. i should have made the traffic call, but was preoccupied with the events above. in the event of a go around on zzz1 runway yy, either zzz1 tower or the zzz1 radar final coordinator needs to immediately verbally coordinate with [sector x tracon] what the aircraft is doing and to \push up\ the data block to sector x. if i had observed the traffic, at best i could only give a traffic call because i did not know the intentions of the b737 because there was no coordination whatsoever. i would also recommend that the on the zzz1 runway yy ils approach plate have a note that in the event of a go around to be aware the zzz final to xxl crosses right over them on a 6 mile final at 2,900 ft (abcde crossing restriction.),during an attempted night ils in weather to runway yy at zzz1, i encountered windshear. as captain, i was vectored to final and cleared for the approach. near 2,600 ft msl, we encountered windshear, losing 30 kts. the autopilot pitched up 25 degrees attempting to maintain altitude. i abandoned the approach and initiated a recovery. the altitude and speed were stabilized at 3,000 ft msl. the tower and tracon coordinated our missed approach. we did receive a ta for zzz traffic without an ra. our altitude assignment was adjusted to 5,000 ft msl and we were vectored for a second and successful approach and landing. the missed approach was complicated by the fact that we were unable to complete the descent to the initial altitude of 1,800 ft msl. we were therefore not able to descend on the glideslope and recover at the lower charted missed approach altitude.,[we were] cleared for ils approach to runway yy in zzz1. at approximately 2,800 ft, we were vectored to join final inside fghij intersection. very shortly after intercepting final and beginning descent to glideslope intercept altitude, i (pilot not flying) already had visual contact with the surface below and as the field was reporting vmc, was focusing my look out of the window. we had briefed the ils yy and included in that brief was our expectation of visual contact with the runway outside the final approach fix. we had been handed off to zzz1 tower, but the frequency was busy and had not yet been able to check in with them. while looking outside the window for the runway, i felt the nose come up a lot and the engines spool up to a high power setting and the airspeed drop off to vref. once regaining acceptable parameters of pitch and airspeed, the glideslope, which had been \alive\ before the upset, went full scale to the high side. even though we had expected to see the runway, we had not yet seen it, and elected to go around rather than continue descent from a full scale glideslope deflection. about the time we achieved clean configuration in our go around maneuver, i as pilot not flying, was able to contact zzz1 tower and ask them for their altitude preference for us. they gave us either 3,000 ft or 4,000 ft (i do not recall), but we were at 3,400 ft and climbing slowly by the time we got our altitude instructions from zzz1 tower. tower said there was a b747 crossing below us, which we saw on tcas but had no visual contact. this resulted in a ta (traffic alert), but not an ra (resolution advisory). zzz1 tower handed us off to approach, who vectored us back for landing.    preventative measures: we believe we encountered wind shear, which cannot be prevented, but it was mild and easily recovered from. since we began the missed approach even before we got to the final approach fix, and high above the published glideslope intercept altitude, perhaps atc would have expected us to perform a descending go around down to gsia, which was a published altitude. contributing factors might have been a relatively early hand off to tower, relatively far outside the faf, which would normally be fine, but becomes awkward for both pilots and the tower controller if the pilots have to break off that far out, while essentially still in the final approach controller's airspace; i don't know. this is one of those awkward things that is not cut and dry and does not happen often. if indeed a descending

121,"i must report that in my opinion the ipad is not ready for prime time. as a very experienced computer user (and ipad owner from day one), i feel i have a pretty good grasp of the intended concept and can clearly use an ipad to its fullest extent. within minutes of testing the company ipad i quickly determined the search feature to be useless and limiting when searching for key elements such as \stabilized approach\. this only sent me to a chapter reference not to the page i needed to review. searching is one of the most important features of any electronic document reader and when it is limited in capability as the current feature is, it becomes useless. in a time crunch one might find during an irregular procedure, this thing is useless imo. the \bookmark\ feature does not allow any title to be assigned and therefore more than one bookmark simply appears as an unidentifiable mini icon that cannot be discerned from other bookmarks (icons) that may have been archived. you therefore loose the purpose of quickly referencing a bookmark for quick resource. i also lost my position several times, as the ipad software would randomly go to some other chapter when i touched the left arrow on the screen designed to hide the menu and open a full page view. i can reproduce this anytime for those who doubt me. it appears to me that the company has again chosen the cheapest proprietary version of some textual software that only mimics the capability of adobe.pdf presentations. simply putting the downloadable company adobe files (fom or fm) on my personal ipad provides a quicker, better and safer reference than the pathetic software used on the company ipad application. i would not even hand these things out until they get a little more serious about the use of this product in flight. as far as i am concerned it sits on the shelf at home until they want it back or fix the issues. there is also no functional training on how to use the ipad document reader. i can only imagine someone trying to find the support information in flight and then losing the page or not knowing how to restore the page while distracted.",a320 captain laments the search ability of his company issued ipad flight manual.
122,"flight had a scheduled departure. i arrived at the airport, checked in and preceded to the aircraft ahead of schedule. the airplane was cold with everything shut down. i proceeded to do my check and noticed the maintenance logbook with a blue sticker on the cover with mel 23-31, indicating that the aircraft pa system was inoperative. i read the mel, to see what procedures were required. i then followed up with reading the fom. though the mel allowed for departure, the fom required its use during latin america operations. the fom has 'highlighted' specific language i am required to say over the pa when departing a non-us airport to the united states. i am to read the italicized statement, \verbatim\, to the passengers. i called the dispatcher to discuss whether the aircraft was legal. the dispatcher came to the same conclusion as i and would coordinate with maintenance to get a different aircraft. i had provided my cell phone number to the dispatcher, so he could call me directly when he had another aircraft for us. other than now realizing we may be running late, i felt comfortable knowing that everyone that was involved with our flight knew of the situation, the aircraft swap and that we were now only awaiting a call from dispatch with the new aircraft number and gate. i chose to use this time to brief the flight attendant's in order to help expedite our now late departure. my phone rang, thinking it was dispatch, i answered only to find out it was an assistant chief pilot. the assistant chief pilot seemed to know what was going on in respect to our flight, the aircraft, the aircraft mel and the procedure for mel 23-31. he made the comment that the aircraft was legal, but if i did not think it was safe he was okay with my decision. i then explained to the assistant chief pilot what was in the fom and he then fully understood the problem we had with the aircraft with that particular mel. after hanging up, i resumed my briefing with the flight attendants. again my phone rang, and again it was the assistant chief pilot. this time, rather than question the decision to switch airplanes, he began explaining that now we would have many misconnects if i didn't hurry the departure, do a quick turn and hurry back! i wasn't sure how to respond to this request, since it sure sounded as if he wanted me to violate the fom standard operating procedures, other than to say, we would do our best.    unfortunately, the assistant chief pilot's politeness appeared to only disguise the message i heard, the first time he called, which was that i was making the wrong decision about the safety of the aircraft. since the decision to switch aircraft was a joint decision between the dispatcher, myself and possibly maintenance control, i felt that the assistant chief pilot's objective for calling me (without knowing all the facts), was to intimidate me and harassing in nature. additionally, with my, 28 years of service for this airline, i feel the assistant chief pilot's first call to me was not typical or normal; his second call to me crossed the line in every professional and ethical way. if what his true objective was to help me, he failed. he did however; succeed in pushing me into the \yellow\ even before we left the ground. i do not know how it was that the assistant chief pilot came to know that we had a delay and why, since he never said. he also did not start the conversation asking what the problem was, rather presumably knowing everything about our flight (which is how he initiated the conversation), it was more condescending.",a320 captain explains the reasoning behind his rejection of an aircraft for a flight to a caribbean island with a non-functional pa system.

145,"on climbout on the all-nighter to the east coast, we were given a clearance direct to pevee. as the pilot flying i brought pevee to the top of the legs page and somehow dumped the box. i tried typing in pevee to proceed direct but must have miss-spelled the waypoint. atc called and asked if we were proceeding direct to pevee, we responded that we were working on it. atc gave us a vector to pevee. we were able to load pevee, proceed direct, and re-load the entire route. i am not sure how i dumped the box, but i should have been slower with the box work, insured the pilot flying verified the proposed change and then executed. i also should have asked for a vector earlier when i dumped the box, instead of trying to type in the waypoint at night.","a b767-300 flight crew suffered a momentary track deviation when their attempts to program a \direct to a fix clearance\ on their fmc, their active route was lost. atc provided a vector while they reprogrammed the route."
146,"all operations were normal up until this point. the flight attendant was doing her normal duties as well when she received several calls from passengers. there was smoke coming from the ceiling and walls of the aircraft. she immediately called us and notified as of the situation. while she was informing us i started to smell an acrid smoke. we immediately donned our o2 masks and smoke goggles. we shut off the recirculation fan shortly after that.     with the memory items completed, i called atc and declared an emergency and requested an immediate vector back to our departure airport. we turned toward the airport and started a descent. i proceeded to go through the cabin smoke qrh checklist. after that, i went through the smoke evacuation qrh checklist. everything happened very quickly. by the time we went through the checklists, we were at about 10,000 ft and continuing the descent for landing. we requested runway xx for landing and that emergency equipment meet us. everything was briefed and the normal checklists were accomplished. i notified the captain we would be making an overweight landed which he acknowledged and we both agreed was necessary. we called the flight attendant for an update several times as to the condition in the cabin. she told us that the smoke was indeed dissipating and had mostly gone away by the time we were less then 5 minutes from landing.    based on the information, we notified the flight attendant and atc that we were not planning on evacuating on the runway. we landed without incident and pulled off the runway onto the taxiway and stopped the airplane. cfr personnel chocked the airplane and did an external check for smoke or fire. none was found. the flight attendant confirmed that there was no more smoke coming from anywhere in the cabin. we taxied to our assigned gate with cfr escorting us. when we got to the gate, we deplaned the aircraft. the smoke incident and overweight landing was written up.     from what i was told initially from maintenance, the cause of the smoke was from bad bearings in the air cycle machine in pack number two. pack number one was already deferred and not used in flight.    everything went fairly smoothly in my opinion. the crew reacted appropriately. atc and airport operations did an excellent job as well. we got the plane on the ground in a very short period of time, which is the most important thing in a situation like this. smoke is to be taken very seriously in flight and should be treated as a fire with an unknown source. getting the plane down quickly is the top priority.",an emb-145 flight crew declared an emergency and returned to their departure airport when smoke was detected in the cabin and on the flight deck. when the appropriate check lists were completed the smoke abated. they had been dispatched with one pack inoperative and maintenance concluded the smoke emanated from the air cycle machine bearings in the remaining pack.

159,"climbing through 2,000 msl after takeoff the engine failed. the la4-180 with 2 souls on board glided down and landed on a highway 12 miles east of the departure airport. no one was hurt and no damage was done. the aircraft was fixed within hours and an a&p/pilot flew it off the highway and back to its base.    the failure occurred because a fuel line nut became loose and vibration caused it to unwind itself, starving the engine of fuel.","when the engine of their la4-180 failed, due to a failed fuel line connection, the instructor and student aboard made a dead stick landing on a highway not far from their departure airport."
160,"i had planned to make a vfr flight with my fiance. i left work a half hour early to give us plenty of time to complete the flight before dark. i called 1800-wx-brief to obtain a standard weather briefing. i was told by the briefer that the entire route of flight was showing unrestricted visibility.    we departed that evening with full fuel. we had about 20 miles of visibility. i set my nav 2 radio to the vor, selected nav 2 on the audio panel to confirm the id of the vor but could not make it out over the atc chatter on com 1. i deselected com 1 so that i could just hear the vor and only heard an identifier every 30 seconds. i deselected nav 2 and reselected com 1. i heard a transmission from the atc to another aircraft which cut out mid-sentence. my radio reception capability had just failed.     approaching my destination, about 15 miles out, i contacted approach to see if i could get cleared through their class c airspace instead of going around. i did not hear a response. i set my dme equipment to the airport vor and kept an arc distance of 12 dme from the airport vor which would keep me out of their airspace by two miles and bring me right to my destination.     we were approximately 2 miles from our destination when the visibility dropped to about 6 miles. i was over the large channel of water leading into the mouth of the bay and had already started a descent. i could see the power plant situated in the bay about 1.5 miles from the field and could see the lights along the beach of our destination and set myself up for a right base to the runway. approximately 1/2 mile away from our destination, (the miniature airplane on my gps's nose was touching the airport icon), at 600 ft agl - (we were over water with an elevation of 0 agl), the lights of our destination became hazy and about 5 seconds later the airplane entered a dense bank of fog sweeping in from the ocean. i could see the beam of my landing light able to penetrate about 5 ft into the fog. i entered the fog because my line of sight and visibility on the approach looking down from 600 ft was steeper than my actual line of descent, and i could not see the fog against the background of the ocean.    going right to the instruments and calling upon my recent instrument experience, i stopped my descent and climbed 200 ft to 800 ft (a power plant at 500 agl was on my left) before starting a left 180 degree, standard-rate turn. we returned to visual conditions about 15 seconds after reversing course. after coming out of the fog bank the visibility was deteriorating rapidly down to 5 miles and at that time i told my fiancé that we were not going to make it to the beach tonight. as i climbed above 1,000 ft, i set a course back home. at about 1,100 ft i noticed that dense fog was quickly consuming the ground below me at an unimaginable rate. within 10 minutes we were going to be trapped on top. then, right on cue; my gps quit.    at this time i attempted to contact approach again to see if they could provide me with the weather information at my home airport, and at the nearby class c because if conditions were deteriorating as rapidly as they were at my home airport as they were here, it would be socked in ifr before we could get home. i did not hear the transmissions coming from approach and at that time, so with a marginal safety window getting smaller and smaller, i told myself that i had to assume that my home airport was fogging up just as fast as it was where i am, and that a diversion to the class c airport was the best option. it was the closest airport, had the longest runway around and had a vor with dme. my dme was reading 11.0 miles from the class c airport and i tuned my nav 2 vor to take me directly to the airport which was on a heading of 050 from my present location. other than the occasional hole big enough to see a baseball field or parking lot through in the intensifying clouds below me, i had no ground reference to navigate by. thankfully the conditions above 1,500 ft were vmc. i attempted to contact approach one more time stating just my n number and waiting for a response. at 10 miles i started to just give them advisory position reports in case they had other operations going on at the time hoping they could hear me. \approach, this is n***** we are 9.2 dme at 2,000 ft heading 050 directly to the field, conditions are deteriorating and we are heading your way and will attempt to land.    my next position report was at 7.2 miles to which i also did not hear the response (i later learned they were responding). at this time, i thought that the error might be on my end and getting into such close proximity to a large airport with commercial service, i decided the best course of action was to try them again on 121.50 because i knew if anybody would hear me; it would be on that frequency. i stated my position and heading again this time 5 miles from the field. i informed them that my intentions were to over fly the field, and see if i could locate the runway through one of the last remaining holes in the solidifying layer while i circled. i also could not hear the controller's attempts to communicate with me on that frequency. in a final attempt to communicate with the approach controllers and advise them of the urgency of the situation, i selected 7700 on my transponder, because i was told as a student pilot that doing this makes your radar return on their screen \jump out\ and that they would see me coming if they had previously not. at about 1.0 mile dme i asked them to \turn the lights up as high as they would go, so i would have a better chance of seeing them through the cloud deck\. as i watched the dme come within .2 miles and my vor indicator switch from to to from, i knew i was right over the field. i told my fiancé to look out the windows on her side and look for runway lights. within 15 seconds, she had spotted the first 1,000 ft of the runway (i could see the green reil) and pointed them out to me. i made a turn to the left and locked my eyes on the runway.     my next transmission was \atc, we have a runway in sight directly parallel to our present heading, were currently on a downwind and will make a 180 and attempt to land. as i slowed down to vfe and began to lower the flaps, i noticed my altimeter was reading 2,000 ft. to make a normal landing, i would have to fly a longer downwind, but the longer downwind i flew the view of the runway through the opening began to get fuzzier. i knew if i didn't turn now, i could possibly lose my chance to land vfr.     i entered a left base and knew i would be high. i set the power to idle, applied full right rudder, threw in left aileron and put the airplane into a slip at 85 kts. lining up on final, we were coming in at about 85 kts indicated. as i descended through 1,000 ft, my angle to the lights was changing and my once crystal clear view of the runway lights began to disappear right in front of me. 600 ft was getting marginal again and at 400 ft agl there was nothing more than a dim glow surrounding each light. finally, passing through 300 ft, i broke out, everything came into view, extremely clear, i had about 3,000 ft of runway remaining and we had an uneventful landing.     i taxied clear of the runway, pulled out my airport facility directory and opened the back of the book to the airport's diagram to see where i would need to taxi once i received a light gun signal. about a minute later i saw flashing lights of an airport vehicle approaching the aircraft. i shut the engine down and the driver told me he would get in touch with the tower and i could follow him to the fbo. we taxied to the fbo, shut the aircraft down and parked for the night. we got out of the plane, looked up and saw that all the holes in the sky were gone.     i was told by an employee at the fbo that they had been shut down for the past 4 nights due to dense fog and that the airport didn't have any operations going on at that time. a controller in the tracon told me that recently they have been going from great visibility to solid ifr in a small window of 20-30 minutes for the past few nights. he had asked me why i didn't head back home, since they were still reporting 10 miles of visibility and clear skies. i had told the controller that i was calling them to see if they could provide me with the weather at my home airport, but since i could not communicate, i erred on the side of caution and decided the best thing to do was to get the airplane on the ground considering rapidly deteriorating conditions. the only thing going through my mind was i've been to quite a few aviation safety faast seminars and have heard of so many fatal accidents in which pilots had multiple opportunities to get the airplane on the ground and chose to continue on or try the same approach that didn't work the last 3 times because they didn't want to cause a commotion or get in trouble. the speaker in the presentation had a wonderful take on that mindset. \i'd rather be tried by 12 than carried by 6.\ so i told the controller i tried everything i could to communicate with him, position reports,121.5, 7700….really anything to make my intentions known.     i decided right then and there that at the first safe opportunity, i was going to land. in short; i saw a runway through the clouds at the class c airport and i had a 100% opportunity to get on the ground, albeit with the possibility of having a few questions to answer when i landed. i chose that guaranteed lifeline over \hoping\ that i would be able to get in when i got back home.","trapped by imc conditions as he approached his destination the pilot of a pa28, who had previously lost radio reception capability, elected to divert to another airport where he was able to maintain ground contact long enough to make a safe landing."

186,"in 12/88 i was pic of a mil heli on a trning flt which originated from weide army airfield. the heli was equipped with a single ultra hi freq radio and a single fm radio. my observer was sitting in the coplt's seat. weide army airfield is located approx 20 mi ne of baltimore, md. after departing weide army airfield, we proceeded to the area around frederick, md, and thereafter to the carroll county arpt, where we did several apches to a full stop. from carroll county arpt we proceeded ebnd toward weide army airfield. after arriving in the area of weide army airfield at approx xa20, we decided to make a couple of apchs at baltimore airpark, an uncontrolled arpt approx 5 mi s of weide army airfield. we passed over the arpt at approx 1000' above pattern alt to determine the wind and the active rwy. at this time neither my observer nor i observed any fixed wing tfc. we determined that the active rwy was 27 and entered the tfc pattern. we made 1 apch to rwy 27 using a standard pattern and a final of approx 3/4 mi. i did not make pos announcements on unicom or ctaf because the acft lacked a vhf radio. the second apch was to be a steep apch (ie, 12 degs or more) and use the same pattern as the previous apch. i initiated a dscnt from the pattern alt of 1200' msl to an alt of 800' msl on base leg. in order to make a steep apch i held the alt of 800' msl until we were approx 1/4 mi from the apch end of rwy 27. after holding that alt too long, i was closer to the rwy than anticipated, and so i initiated a very quick dscnt by lowering the collective full down. this produced a high rate of dscnt (note that there is no vsi in the heli to determine the rate of dscnt). approx 50' from the rwy i initiated a deceleration maneuver while i was increasing the pwr and rotor pitch by pulling up on the collective. a deceleration maneuver was required by my high rate of dscnt. the acft stabilized approx 15' above the rwy and from this point a very slow, precise lndg was made. after lndg onrwy 27 i had spoken a couple of sentences to my observer and was increasing the pwr by raising the collective when both my observer and i heard the sound of an acft eng. we both looked toward the sound which was to our left and observed a fixed wing acft, sma y, approx 60' lat from our pos and 20' above the rwy. the sma y was in a 30 deg left bank and executing a gar. thereafter, while still at very low alt, the sma y quickly entered a 30 deg right bank, crossed the centerline of rwy 27 and continued clbing to the nw. we lost sight of the acft. we departed rwy 27 and continued looking for the fixed wing acft. on xwind we still had not made vis contact with the acft. just after turning from xwind to downwind we made vis contact with the acft. the acft was at our 7 o'clock pos coming towards us at a high rate of spd. thereafter, we lost sight of the acft as it entered our 6 o'clock pos and reappeared at our 4-5 o'clock pos, approx 1/2 mi behind the acft. the sma y continued to accelerate and positioned his acft at our 3 o'clock pos approx 50-60' lat. the sma y continued to fly at our 3 o'clock pos for approx 30-60 secs. he then accelerated to our 1-2 o'clock pos approx 2000' in front of our acft. he then made a 90 deg left turn which passed directly in front of our acft and crossed perpendicular to our downwind flt path approx 2000' in front of our acft. the sma y then dsnded to approx 600' msl on xwind, and flew at that alt down rwy 27. then the acft turned xwind, downwind and base at the same alt and finally landed on rwy 27. thereafter, the acft taxied over to one of the hangars and parked. this incident arose because of 2 primary factors. the first factor is that the mil equips many of their acft with only uhf radios. these acft are operated in the civilian atc sys where the primary radio is vhf. at uncontrolled arpts this prevents the mil acft from receiving pos announcement from civilian acft over the unicom or ctaf. the second factor in this matter is that a fixed wing acft took advantage of a lndg acft and misjudged distances btwn the 2 acft in violation of the fars.",nmac between mil-helicopter and ga-sma when mil made steep apch to rwy.

196,"this training flight began mid afternoon local time. the aircraft is a cessna 182rg. the purpose of the flight was to evaluate the flight performance of a student intending to take a checkride to add a commercial single-engine airplane rating to the student's license. the student holds a commercial helicopter rating as well as a single-engine private pilot license with both complex and high performance endorsements. the student has been training with another instructor at my company; i was being used to evaluate his progress. the preflight was conducted by the student while i was not present. at the beginning of the flight, the student was told that he was to be the pilot-in-command of the flight and that i was going to evaluate his performance and provide verbal instruction as necessary. the flight began with a short-field takeoff which was performed to pts standards. several commercial maneuvers were evaluated and the student performed each maneuver well within pts standards with most to near perfection. i advised the student to return to the airport to evaluate his landing performance and make the first landing using a short-filed landing technique and to set the wheels down on the 1,000 ft markers. atc advised a right downwind entry for a specific runway and the student made the proper entry onto the downwind, lowered the landing gear, visually and verbally assured the gear were down as well as acknowledge a green light indicating the gear down and locked. i personally, both visually and verbally, checked the gear down as well being able to see the right main gear below my window in its proper gear down location. atc advised for us to change to a right downwind entry for a different runway and the student maneuvered the aircraft accordingly. we were advised that we were number three for landing. the number one aircraft was on very short final approaching the numbers while the number two aircraft was visualized on the left downwind for the same runway abeam our aircraft. the student maintained a visual with the number two aircraft and maneuvered accordingly to provide spacing for a stop-and-go landing. on final, the student made several s-turns to assure adequate spacing at the proceeding aircraft flew a very slow approach. spacing was adequately maintained and the proceeding aircraft had returned airborne following a touch-and-go leaving us plenty of time for our landing. the student configured the aircraft properly with gear down, flaps full-down, and ias at approximately 65 kts on final with a slightly steep approach as is usually done to simulate an obstacle of 50 ft along the approach path. the approach was stabilized, aligned with the center-line, with proper corrections for the slight crosswind and was aiming perfectly for the intended landing spot. as the student rounded out and entered the flair, i watched out the right window to see that the aircraft would land at the intended spot. as the white paint of the 1,000 ft markers came into view, the main gears touched down in the white paint as intended. immediately there was a loud bang, i looked forward, and noticed the nose of the aircraft was dragging on the ground. the propeller was stopped and the tips were curled and damaged. the aircraft skidded to a stop and the student advised atc that we were \down on the runway.\ the student properly shut down the aircraft and we removed our seat-belts and exited the aircraft. the faa was notified accordingly and company reporting policies were followed. neither of us was injured and no medical care was sought. during the flight, i never touched the controls and felt that the student's flying was very good. even on very short final, i never felt the need to provide either verbal or physical correction of the student's actions. the student and i discussed what happened and neither of us understood why the nose gear had collapsed as it had. on future flight, i will assure that students are using the proper configurations, airspeeds, and techniques for landings to be sure this instance never occurs again. the damage to the aircraft is still being evaluated by the company maintenance department. ",a c182rg nose landing gear collapsed during landing with all indications normal up to the point of the collapse.
197,nose gear failed to extend fully and lock down. [we] circled the airfield for approximately one hour and 30 minutes while completing abnormal and emergency checklist. [we] exhausted all options. i completed the emergency checklist for landing with nose gear up. the engine was shut down and feathered on landing at which time 2 prop blades contacted the runway as the nose came down. blades were abraded and bent slightly. aircraft structure was not damaged beyond the 2 prop blades. no passengers were on board. engine was not running and prop was slowly turning when contact with runway occurred. as of this time the cause of the nose gear failure has not been determined. pending further investigation i shall not be able to offer my opinion on cause of malfunction. in my opinion all proper procedures were followed with regards to afm procedure and emergency checklist. i owe a great thanks to the technicians and ground maintenance personnel as they were a valuable asset in assisting me with this problem; very good crm.,"a pc-12 nose landing gear failed to extend, so after all troubleshooting options were exhausted, an emergency nose gear up landing was completed with the propeller feather which resulted in very little damage."
198,"while at 4,500 ft cruise, heading north northwest, using approach radar services, engine began cutting in and out. normal emergency checks failed to solve problem. after about 45 seconds, contacted approach and advised of problem. they directed me to turn north to a nearby airport and continue reporting. continued to lose altitude, advised approach i could go into lake and not make that airport. at approximately 2,000 ft engine regained power. [i] was able to make safe landing, so advised approach. at the airport, local mechanic examined plane and determined i must have had some water in the system. fuel system, checked clear and numerous run-ups showed no issues.",a c150 pilot declared an emergency and diverted after his engine lost power at cruise but power recovered during descent. a mechanic believed water in the fuel was the problem.
199,"[i had a] normal balloon inflation, weather perfect. [i] flew approximately 15 minutes to 1,000 ft agl. control lines to balloon rotator vents became entangled. while attempting to correct vent problem, balloon encountered rapid descent striking surface. balloon recovered to flight with no damage to persons or property. [i] flew on to landing 30 minutes later.",a ballon's rotator vent control lines became entangle resulting the loss of aircraft control and a rapid descent to ground contract. the pilot recovered and continued the flight.
200,"sav radar/arts was the problem. upon assuming the sector, an abnormal amount of data block coasting and \stitching\ was detected and reported to the cic, then the flm. i requested to confirm that we were on the mode s system as the amount of coasting and stitching was indicative that mode s had failed. the mode s monitor indicated green on ch a mode s, so flm was satisfied that all was well, but as the cpc/fpl tasked with separation aircraft, i did not have the tools to safely do so. i had to coordinate arrivals and over flights from zjx  sector, taking radar contact on those i could see primary radar returns in conjunction with their data blocks, but leave them on zjx tags so the zjx computer system could track them automatically. i was unable to track that many primary targets on my own, but this practice is unfair to the zjx sector when it is the sav arts system that is the problem. after i continually reported that the current situation was unsafe, the cic concurred and directed the flm to contact tech ops. i requested the cic to please change the mode s from ch a to ch b in an attempt to reboot the mode s, which regardless of the tracon mode s monitor, was not operating in the digital mode s. after completing the change over and a few minutes of the ch b digital data entering the sav arts system all data blocks began to track successfully. this confirmed what was suspected that the mode s display monitor is not correctly displaying the mode s status for the tracon team. request a replacement system for the current sav arts. the current asr-8 is satisfactory and with the addition of mode s, the presentation can be acceptable. without mode s, it is unacceptable and an unsafe product which impedes our ability to provide basic services to our users. as a quick fix to upgrading the whole arts system, we need some way to know for sure if mode s is or is not operating; the current display/monitor is not. sav needs the next generation of displays and what ever is going to replace the antiquated arts system, and we need it asap! we have a good asr 8, which already has a digitizer on both the secondary and primary portions and those signals also go through the mode s digitizer which runs to the sav base building, where it is dumbed down to an analog signal to go through our equipment. any accident caused by this antiquated equipment in such complex airspace as we have here would greatly harm the faa and our credibility.","sav controller voiced concern regarding radar/arts mode s problems, describing a recent event and suggesting the replacement of some of the subject equipment. reporter suggests improved trouble shooting and technical support."
